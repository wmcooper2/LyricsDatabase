Here was I, a Gypsy
Looking for a world to roam in
Now the world is in my arms

No more endless searching for
A place to feel at home in
For the world is in my arms

Mexican hill flower the sky
Sappoco sees here in your eye

When I see you smile
I see the sunset of Geneva
What's that magic in your charms

When I hold you
I hold the world
Right here in my arms
