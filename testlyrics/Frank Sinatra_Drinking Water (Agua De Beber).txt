Your love is rain, my heart the flower 
I need your love or I will die
My very life is in your power
Will I wither and fade or bloom to the sky
Água de beber
Give the flower water to drink
Aqua de beber
Give the flower water to drink

The rain can fall on distant deserts 
The rain can fall upon the sea
The rain can fall upon the flower
Since the rain has to fall, let it fall on me
Água de beber 
Água de beber camará
Água de beber
Água de beber camará
