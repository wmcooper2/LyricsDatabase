I like you talking dirty
I like your filthy love
You like the way I hold you
When we are falling in love
(Yo sé que sí)
In love
(Mami yo sé que sí) If it's love
Then I don't want to come back up

Girl I know you're a handful
'Cause you know what you like
You might be hard to handle
But imma show you tonight
(Pero que rica estás)
Tonight (Qué rica estás)
What it's like (What it's like)

Stuck on a feeling

Better box it up
Gotta work me out

Gotta make it count

Won't you show me your place
A little peace and quiet
Where we can both
Misbehave (misbehave)
Misbehave (misbehave) it's okay (it's okay)

Wheelin' and dealin appealin I'm realin'
Ya still in love with me
All green
I'm at it, romantic, no panic, organic
Slide right next to me in ecstasy
Now who could ever make you feel like I felt
You're layin on your bed, just playing
You're moaning and groaning
You're squirming and squealing
Guess it's true, I left you

Once ain't enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
