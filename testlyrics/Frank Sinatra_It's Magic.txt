You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins, it's magic
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes, it's magic
Without a golden wand or mystic charms,
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms

When we walk hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland, it's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows when there isn't rain? It's magic
Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?
