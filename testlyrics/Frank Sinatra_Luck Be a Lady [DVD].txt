Well, they call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady-like way
Of running out

Your on this date with me
And the pickin's have been lush
And yet before the evening is over
You might give me the brush

You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray

Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Please be a lady tonight

Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame I can be
I know the way you've treated
All those girls before me
Please be a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, and it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And then blow on some other guys dice

Why do we keep [Incomprehensible] eyes
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby
I'm the girl that you came in with
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated
All those girls before me
Luck be a lady with me

A lady never flirts with strangers
She have a heart, she'll be nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And then blow on some other guys dice

So why don't we keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight, no way
Stick with me, baby
I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be a lady

Luck be a lady, luck be a lady
This very night, this night
Be a lady
