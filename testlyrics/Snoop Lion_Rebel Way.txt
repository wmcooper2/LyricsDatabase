You can’t run away, run away 
You gotta face this 
You can’t run away, run away 
You gotta face this 
Time is moving fast 
Can’t dwell on the past 
Make this moment last
While we have the chance
All dreams will fade
For the new ones made 
Nothing stays the same 
Do it the rebel way 

From moonlight to sunrise 
Day in and day out 
I stay on my 
Modus operandi 
Opening my third eye 
Fuck this on the words I say 
Man stand a diligent, militant 
With the sentiment, I’m here to represent 
Constant changes like passin' ranges
Evident, the time we spend to sacred 

You can’t run away, run away 
You gotta face this 
You can’t run away, run away 
You gotta face this 
Time is moving fast 
Can’t dwell on the past 
Make this moment last
While we have the chance
All dreams will fade
For the new ones made 
Nothing stays the same 
Do it the rebel way 

We still drop it hardcore 
Nuff a dem can’t take it 
When the lion roar 
Remote take no shorts tellin' we want more 
Now it’s time to settle the score, hey
For all of my people in the ghetto streets reppin'
And all who feel they been stepped on 
Love is the cure and courage is the weapon 
You can use to overcome 

You can’t run away, run away 
You gotta face this 
You can’t run away, run away 
You gotta face this 
Time is moving fast 
Can’t dwell on the past 
Make this moment last
While we have the chance
All dreams will fade
For the new ones made 
Nothing stays the same 
Do it the rebel way 

Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way 
Do it the rebel way
