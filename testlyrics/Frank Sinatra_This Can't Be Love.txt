This can't be love because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love, I get no dizzy spell
My head is not in the skies

My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat
This is too sweet, oops, to be love

This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes

My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat
This is too sweet to be love

This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes
Yes, I love to look, baby, right in your eyes
