The moon was all aglow and heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies.
The stars all seemed to know that you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me those little white lies.

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears,
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears.
The devil was in your heart but heaven was in your eyes
The night you told me those little white lies.
