Blue skies (look up, look up) smilin' at me
(Take the azure in the dome, boy)
Nothin' but blue skies (it's mellow, fellow) do I see
(Blue skies, blue skies)

Bluebirds (did you ever) singin' a song
(Hear the bluebirds singin' the blues)
Nothin' but bluebirds (you won't say no) all day long
(The happy little birds, flap, flap happy)
(Sunshine everywhere, and everybody's happy)
(As a square at the fair, hoy, hoy)

All the days are hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days (talk about blue)
All of them gone (makes no misery, hmm, hmm)
Nothin' but blue skies (overhead)
From now on (Mister Elman, go ahead, go ahead)
