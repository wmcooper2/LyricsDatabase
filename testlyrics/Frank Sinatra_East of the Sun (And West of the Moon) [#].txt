East of the sun and west of the moon,
We'll build a dream house so lovely
Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night,
We'll live in a lovely way dear

Living our love in memory
Just you and I, forever and a day,
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way,
Up among the stars we'll find

A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear,
East of the sun and west of the moon.
