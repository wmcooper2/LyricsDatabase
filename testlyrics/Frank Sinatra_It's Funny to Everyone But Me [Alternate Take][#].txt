It's funny how you loved me, then forgot so suddenly,
It's funny to everyone but me.
(It's the talk of the town)
They told me this would happen, now they're laughing secretly,
It's funny to everyone but me.
(gosh, he's crying again)
I should shrug my shoulders and say, good riddance to a bad affair,
But how can I do, but my head tells me to,
When my heart tells me how much I care?
It's so funny I still love you, it's the joke of the century,
It's funny to everyone but me.
(I got the right to think of you)
It's so funny I still love you, it's the joke of the century,
Ah but it's funny to everyone but me.
