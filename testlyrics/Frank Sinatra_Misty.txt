Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten
Up a tree
And I feel like I'm
Hanging from a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty

Just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
This magic I hear
I get misty

The moment you're near
You could say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see just how hopelessly I'm drawn
That's why I'm following you
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty

And too much in love
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat and my glove
I get misty

Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat and my glove
I get misty
And too much in love
Look at me
