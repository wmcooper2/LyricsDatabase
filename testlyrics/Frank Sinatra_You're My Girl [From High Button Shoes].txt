You're my girl the boys all know, you're my girl, I've told them so.
You should have seen how their faces fell when they were wishing me well.
They called me a lucky guy, and I couldn't hide a feeling of pride.
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine, my whole life through.
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,
You're what I've waited for, and you're my girl.

The kids that see me come to call have written your name and my name on the wall.
It's common gossip everywhere, that you and I have got it bad for fair.
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine my whole life through,
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,
You're what I've waited for, and you're my girl.
