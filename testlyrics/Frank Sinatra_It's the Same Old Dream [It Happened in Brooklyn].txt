I can see a steeple - surrounded by people
Oh how real it all starts to seem
Just as the choir is singing - my alarm starts ringing
It's the same old dream
And then my thoughts inspire - a scene by a fire
In a cottage close by a stream
I know it all by heart now - we're about to part now
It's the same old dream
If you but knew
How many times I pretend - that I'm with you
I'm sure your heart would unbend - you'd see me through
Until my dream had a happy ending
And I can picture clearly - the things I love dearly
In the center you reign supreme
We kiss and I discover - I'm a lonesome lover
It's the same old dream
