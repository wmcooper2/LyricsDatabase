I cover the waterfront, I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?
I cover the waterfront in search of my love
And I'm covered by a starless sky above

Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and longing
Oh, how I yearn! Where are you? Are you forgetting?
Do you remember? Will you return?
I cover the waterfront, I'm watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to me
