I'm a glum one, it's explainable, I met someone unattainable
Life's a bore, the world is my oyster no more
All the papers where I lead the news with my capers, now will spread the news
Superman turns out to be flash-in-the-pan

I've been around the world in a plane, designed the latest IBM brain
But lately I'm so downhearted, 'cause I can't get started with you
In Cincinnati or in Rangoon, I simply smile and all the gals swoon
Their whims I've more than just charted, but I can't get started with you

O tell me why am I no kick to you, I who'd always stick to you
Fly through thin and thick to you, tell me why I'm taboo
Each time I chanced to see Franklin D., he always said, Hi buddy to me
And with queens I've a la carted, but I can't get started with you
