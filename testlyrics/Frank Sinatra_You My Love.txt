My love is ever you, my love
Now and forever, you my love
You walked into my lonely world
What peace of mind your smile unfurled

Yes, and because of you, my love
My wishful dreams came true, my love
In my uncertain heart, I am only certain
Of how much I love you, my love

In my uncertain heart, I am only certain
Of how much I love you, my love
