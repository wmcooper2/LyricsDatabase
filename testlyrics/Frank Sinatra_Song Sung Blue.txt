Song sung blue, everybody knows one
Song sung blue, every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when ya take the blues and make a song
Ya sing 'em out again

Song sung blue, weepin' like a willow
Song sung blue, sleepin' on my pillow
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it starts to feelin' good
Ya simply got no choice
