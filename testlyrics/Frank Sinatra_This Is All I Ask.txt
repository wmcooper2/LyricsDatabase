As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure
All the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede
This is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls
Walk a little slower
When you walk by me
Lingering sunsets
Stay a little longer
With the lonely sea
Children everywhere
When you shoot
At bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange
Enchanted land grown-ups
Seldom understand

Wandering rainbows
Leave a bit of color
For my heart to own
Stars in the sky
Make my wish come true
Before the night has flown
And let the music play
As long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than Spring
