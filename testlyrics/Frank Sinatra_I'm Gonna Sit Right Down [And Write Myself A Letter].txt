I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses at the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And I'll close the way I do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you

I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say I hope that you're much better
The I'll close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and knock out a very large letter
And make believe it came
Though it's not the same
I'll make believe it came from you
