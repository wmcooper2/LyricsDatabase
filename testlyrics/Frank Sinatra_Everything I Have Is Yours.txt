Everything I have is yours, you're part of me
Everything I have is yours, my destiny
I would gladly give the sun to you, if the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you and the stars that shine
Everything that I possess I offer you
Let my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life, waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours, my life, my all
I'd be happy just to spend my life, waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours, my life, my all
