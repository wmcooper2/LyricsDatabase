I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the gray skies to blue
If I had you

And I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
And I could start my life all anew
If I had you

I could climb the snow-capped mountains
I could sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side

I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I couldn't do
If I had you

I could climb the very highest mountain
Or I could sail the mighty ocean wide
I could also cross the burnin' desert
If I had you by my side

I could be a king crowned or uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I couldn't do
If I had you

If I had you
