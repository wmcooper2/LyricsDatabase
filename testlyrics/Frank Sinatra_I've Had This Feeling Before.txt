I've had this feeling before but never like this
Love had me reeling before but never like this
Who ever dreamed this could happen
To someone supposed to be smart
I must have really been napping
To let you walked off with my heart

My dreams, and I had quite a few, were never like this
This is too good to be true, but so was that kiss
I know by the way my heart leaps
That this time I'm playing for keeps

Yes, I've had this feeling before
Darling, but never like this
