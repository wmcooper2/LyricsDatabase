"Have you met Miss Jones?" someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me
And then I said, "Miss Jones, you're a girl who understands
I'm a man who must be free"
And all at once I lost my breath, and all at once was scared to death
And all at once I owned the earth and sky
And now I've met Miss Jones, and we'll keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I

And all at once I lost my breath, and all at once was scared to death
And all at once I owned the earth and the sky
Now I've met Miss Jones, and we'll keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I, Miss Jones and I, Miss Jones and I
