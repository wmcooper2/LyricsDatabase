I poured my heart into a song,
And I'm afraid the words I chose are not so smart;
I couldn't think of clever things to say in my song,
I had to say it with my heart.

If it's never played
On the hit parade,
It will still contain a heart that is beating true.
If it's not a hit
I won't mind a bit,
Long as it conveys a love that I bear for you.

Oh, here is my heart wrapped in a song,
And if you take it please don't tear my song apart,
For if you do you won't be just destroying a song,
You will be tearing up my heart.
