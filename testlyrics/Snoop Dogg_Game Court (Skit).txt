Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
With trumped up charges against my client
Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For 227 counts of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's

The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
With trumped up charges against my client
Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For 357 counts of verbal and reckless endangerment

From the million dollar mouthpiece
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused
And shook up, like a pair of dice

The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
Charging my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines
With the intent to pimp the system

Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before twelve G's and open up his files
And you will see that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up, ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension

So all you jerks with them eleven dollar words
Comin' out of your two dollar mouth
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack, I said

He's a five-star guerilla Crip with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin' for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
To grant a motion of 995 grounds of dismissal
