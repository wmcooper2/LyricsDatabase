Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams,
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way.

Oh, where's that worn out wish that I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.
