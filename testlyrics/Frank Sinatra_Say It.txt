Say it over and over again, 
Over and over again, 
Never stop saying you're mine.
Say it, 
Ever and ever so sweet, 
Ever and ever so sweet just like an old valentine.
When you say I love you, 
The same old I love you, 
They whisper in stories and plays,
You can change I love you, 
The same old I love you, 
To oh such a heavenly phrase.
So say it, 
Softly and gently and then, 
Over and over again, 
Never stop saying you're mine.
