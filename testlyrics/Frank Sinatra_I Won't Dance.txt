I won't dance, don't ask me. 
I won't dance, don't ask me. 
I won't dance, madame, with you. 
My heart won't let me do things they should do. 
You know what? You're lovely. 

You know what, you're lovely. You know what, you're so lovely.
And, oh what you do to me. 
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore;
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor. 

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle, 
'Specially when you do the Continental. 

But this feeling isn't purely mental, 
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos. 
And that's why I won't dance, why should I? 
I won't dance, how could I? 
I won't dance. Merci beaucoup. 
I know that music leads the way to romance, 
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance.

I won't dance, don't ask me. 
I won't dance, don't ask me. 
I won't dance, madame, with you. 
My heart won't let my feet do things they want to do. 

You know what? You're lovely, ring-a-ding,ding, you're lovely.
And, oh what you do to me.
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore;
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor.

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle, 
'Specially when you do the Continental.

But this feeling isn't purely mental, 
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos. 
And that's why I won't dance.I won't dance. 
I won't dance. Merci beaucoup. 
I know that music leads the way to romance, 
So if I hold you in my arms,
I won't dance!
