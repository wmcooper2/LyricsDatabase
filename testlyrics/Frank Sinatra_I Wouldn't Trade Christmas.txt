I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I,
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best,
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I,
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best.

It's time for the holly's of fun, and the folly or all of that jolly jazz,
The people are glowing, the sand is now showing, each window is showing it has
All the latest in choicing, the daddy invoicing and all that razzle that does,
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for New Year's Day,

Thanksgiving, Halloween and the rest. Christmas we love you the best.
I wouldn't trade, no, no. never would I, wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best.
The traffic gets poky, the turkey gets smoky, and all of that holy stuff,
The people are shopping for things they'll be swapping like filigree boxes of snuff,

Though you pour the hot toddy, to force everybody, though half of the toddy's enough,
I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Father's Day or Mother's,
Valentine, and the rest, Christmas we love you the best.
The jingle fell jingle you feel the old tingle, you buy the first single scene.

The idea is clever but subways will never quite handle that huge evergreen.
And the old office party, with Stanley and Molly keep drinking until they turn green.
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Labor Day, or Easter, 
Washington and the rest, Christmas we love you the best.
