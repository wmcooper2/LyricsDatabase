All of me, why not take (come on get) all of me
Can't you see, I'm no good (just a mess) without you

Take my lips, I want to lose them
Take (Get a piece of) my (these) arms, I'll never use them

Your good-bye, left me with eyes that cry
How can I, get along (ever make it) without you

(You know) You took (got) the part, that once was (used to be) my heart
So why not, why not take all of me
