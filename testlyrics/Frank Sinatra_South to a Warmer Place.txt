I'd be glad to stay right here with you
Fact is, that is what I'd planned to
But from that fool look on your face
I think I'll head South to a warmer place

Thought I'd given you the best of me
I'd be glad to share the rest of me
But there's a chill in your embrace
So, I'd better head South to a warmer place

Seems like yesterday we could kiss and build a fire
But now it's ten below
Seems like yesterday nights were warm with love's desire
But now it feels like snow

I don't mind a cold day now and then
But this long deep freeze has done me in
And it's too late to plead your case
So I'm goin' South to a warmer place
