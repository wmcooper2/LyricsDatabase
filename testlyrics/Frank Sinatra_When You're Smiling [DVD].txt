When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughin', when you're laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that cryin', be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you

When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world, it smiles with you
When you're laughin', oh babe, when you're laughin'
The sun would-a come shining through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that sighin', come on and be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby
The whole world smiles with you
