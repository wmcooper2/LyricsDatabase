Ah, check one yeah, we going back to the hip hop shower
Non stopping, yeah
Well the DJs use the turn tables like Gods, oh
We're just having fun and nobody gets shot
Now, uh where's my leading lady?
Now we're moving forward to hip hop and phone
With Snoop and Bootsy using musical lyric
To spike you're one strip

Heaven saw all our blitz
I don't know your name, but I think I want a kiss, yeah
I know you're fine like the wine I drink
And you may not get a second chance to make a first impression
So take the opportunity, yeah

I pop these parties like I pop MCs
I never need a ride 'cause I carry my own keys
And if you wanna hang with us, telling is all good now
All we do around here is, um play with our toys
Swing down and get that frown off your face
Yeah, all we do around here is party in the place

Swing down, let me hear you all say
Party in the place, party in the place
That's all we do around here baby
Party in the place
Get that frown off your face
Party in the place, party in the place

Just sipping on gin and juice, 
Trying to catch up with mother goose
Yeah she got that golden egg,
And now she trippin' all in my head
