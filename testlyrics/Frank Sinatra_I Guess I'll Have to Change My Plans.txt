I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began, 

Before I knew where I was at, 
I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found, 
  
I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
Why did I buy those blue pajamas, 
Before the big affair began, 
    
My boiling point is much to low 
For me to try to be a fly Lothario, 
I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell, 
Dwelling in my personal hell, 
    
I'll have to change my plan around, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found.
