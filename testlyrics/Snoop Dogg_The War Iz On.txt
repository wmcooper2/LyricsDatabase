We so thuggish ruggish
(The motherfucking war iz on)
You better suit up and do like Krayzie Bone
'Cause the motherfucking war iz on
What you gon' do, what you gon' do, do?

Say nigga we marching, stompin' in the big black boots
With my niggas in the fatigue suits ready to shoot
Running with the AK 47
Niggas trying to survive they ain't trying to go to heaven

Motherfuckers shooting, they ain't even asking questions
It's these young ass niggas, they straight up thugged out
They killas like that little soldier boy
'Cause we livin' in the killin' field

Tombstone soldier rest in peace a real warrior
Nigga been ready for war we are
The motherfuckers on the street with the heat
Knockin' them hoes off they feet

Say boy it's a jungle out there
Get a couple casualties every year
The goal is to stay alive
The mission is to make money

The enemy, the police
We gotta bust back at 'em make some
Motherfucking examples out them assholes
We're not even concerned strike a match drop it on the gas

And let the motherfucker burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Army strategic and I pledge allegiance to the 12 gauge Mossberg
I'm that nigga Mr. Sawed-off Leather face got a big gun in your face
Behind that bush and when they roll by

We jump out the bush make a push
Bstin' why they runnin' buckin' everything comin' murda
Y'all ain't said nothin'
Got a couple of niggas for that

Stay strapped from the front to the back
And the extra clip off in my jacket
So when I run out I restack it and pap it some more
We ready for war

So what nigga, pull your gun
That's exactly how we play
Screaming bloody murda mo all day
The buckshots spray daily all day

Money makes murders sex lies crimes fo-fives
Nines heaters jackers killa
Cap pealers and drug dealers
Snitches snakes bitches fakes

Bad breaks and heartaches
Give and take shake and bake
Boy, I gots to stack my plate
Bad news travels fast

Real mashers always mask
Give a dog a bone send him on he bound
To come home with some cash
Get you shit stack your chips, tuck your heat watch that bitch

She might be cute but listen here
My nigga that don't mean shit
Duck and dodge camouflage
My entourage is way in charge

Krayzie Bone and Dog Capone
Yeah, you know the war is on
Break a bitch shoot a snitch
Fuck a trick get your grip

Smoke, some dank pass some drank
And get off into this gangsta shit
Laying fools down Dog Pound Bone Thugs on love
And we banging from the streets to the club

So what nigga, pull your gun
That's exactly how we play
Screaming bloody murda mo all day
The buckshots spray daily all day

Check it out
Gangstas hoes, I suppose
Dip and dash cock and blast
Kurupt and Snoop Krayzie Daz

Layzie blazing up the hash
G'd as fuck gangstafied
High as the sky gangsta for life
Fuck a bitch hit a switch

Gangstas drop that gangsta shit
I'm a G, DPG, DPGC, O.G. DP
Ride on niggas blast on niggas
Dip and put the smash in niggas

It's a war It's a war
(There's a war going on)
When the was pop off where the fuck you gon be
In the front or the back city under attack

Every nigga from the nine nine front line
Marchin' with a tech nine nigga, where my thugz at
If you scared go to church motherfucker
Matter fact while you at it say a prayer for me

I'm prepared to heat, heat a nigga in the streets
With a goddamn beat my heat lose to me
Khakis suits and fatigues
Nigga dressed to kill

Nigga, yes, I will put a slug in you
Nigga what you wanna do
Cause I'm ready to shoot
And my high tech boots got me feeling bulletproof

I'm a superman nigga GI Joe
Like the wind blowing through a niggas area
More dead enemies I count up the merrier
And you ain't heard no collaboration scarier

I'm a walkin' nightmare and I'm born to die
It's a war goin' on what's happening
If you disrespecting my family
I'll be hell to tell the captain

Fuck all you playa haters and you po-pos
Fuck all you politicians this war
Dedication to the criminal nation
Let the real thugs even the score

So what nigga, pull your gun
That's exactly how we play
Screaming bloody murda mo all day
The buckshots spray daily all day
