For every man there's a woman
For every life there's a plan
And wise men know it was ever so
Since the world began, woman was made for man
Where is she, where is the woman for me?
For every prince there's a princess
For every Joe there's a Joan
And if you wait, you will find the mate
Born for you alone, happy to be your own
Where is she, where is the woman for me?
 
Find the one, find the one
Then together you will find the sun

For every heart there's a moment
For every hand, a glove
And for every woman, a man to love
For every heart there's a moment
For every hand, a glove
And for every woman, a man to love
Where is she, where is the one for me?
