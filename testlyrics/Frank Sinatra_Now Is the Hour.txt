Now is the hour when we must say goodbye.
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea.
While you're away, oh, then, remember me.
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.

Sunset glow fades in the west. Night o'er the valley is creeping.
Birds cuddle down in their nest, soon all the world will be sleeping.
Now is the hour when we must goodbye.
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea.

While you're away, oh, then, remember me.
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.
