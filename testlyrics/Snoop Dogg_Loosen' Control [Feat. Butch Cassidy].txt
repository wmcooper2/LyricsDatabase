Man, you got me goin' crazy Baby
I'm losin' my mind

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy (Snoop Dogg)]
(Butch Cassidy)
Feels like I'm losin' control
And I don't even know
Girl you hurt me oh so bad 'cause I love you so, hey
But it don't matter now
I'm doin' better now
Whatever you do, Bitch
Will come back to you, Bitch
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(I was in love at times)
(I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes)

[Snoop Dogg (Butch Cassidy)]
Now who would ever think that I wanted her home?
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin' somethin' on the side? It didn't make sense
(I'm a family man sportin' a wedding band)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gone make it through
(The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in)
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, 
"Don't worry about what the fuck I be doin'"
We was makin' chemistry, but who is he?
And how this nigga know the deal about you and me?
(I fell to my knees and asked the girl "Why?")
She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I was in love at times
They say game don't wait, ha Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin' my time while I'm writin' these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin' wines
Girl, you's a dime
Got me losin' my mind
Well if lovin' you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never,
Thought you could've
Up out the hood-uh
Is where I took you
Never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
You know what girl?
I was in love with you and you treated me like that,
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

[Butch Cassidy]
How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin' up my songs
Now a nigga must move on
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me
Had a nigga sick for weeks
Now I must begin my streak
