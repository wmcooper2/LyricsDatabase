When i take my sugar to tea,
All the boys are jealous of me,
'cause i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take my sugar to tea.
I'm a rowdy dowdy,
That's me, she's a high hat baby, that's she,
So i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take my sugar to tea.
Every Sunday afternoon,
We forget about our cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz,
With those millionaires.
When i take my sugar to tea,
I'm as ritzy as i can be,
'cause i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take my sugar to tea.
(musical interlude)
Every Sunday afternoon,
We forget about those cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz,
With those zillionaires.
When i take my sugar to tea,
I'm as ritzy as i can be,
'cause i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take, take my sugar to tea.
