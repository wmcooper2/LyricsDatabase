Wait for me my love, my restless heart must roam,
Wait for me my love and I'll be coming home.
But now I can't change, something strange lures me on:
My love, can't you see I'm not free till it's gone?

Wait for me my love, for I am young in dreams,
And my heart must chase those ripples on the streams;
So keep faith in your heart, keep your love ever true,
For if you felt like me I'd wait for you!

So keep faith in your heart, keep your love ever true,
For if you felt like me I'd wait for you!
