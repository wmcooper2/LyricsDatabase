You vowed your love, from here to eternity
A love so true, it never would die
You gave your lips, gave them so willingly
How could I know, your kiss meant goodbye

Now I'm alone, with only a memory
My empty arms, will never know why
Though you are gone, this love that you left with me
Will live from here to eternity

Now I'm alone, with only a memory
My empty arms, will never know why
Though you are gone, this love that you left with me
This endless desire
Will live from here to eternity
