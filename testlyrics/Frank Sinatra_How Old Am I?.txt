How old am I, I'm old enough to know
The difference between infatuation
And a love that has a chance to grow

How old am I, I'm not too old to hear
The sweet ring of truth and understanding
When the words I love you reach my ear

Don't mind these lines beneath my eyes
They're well earned souvenirs
Of a thousand nights of laughter
And occasional tears
And I hope you won't be jealous
Of the silver in my hair
It took many lover's quarrels
To put it there

How old am I, you kiss me and I'm young
Love's a road never traveled
Life's a song I've never sung
If I make you happy today
I'm the perfect age
As for tomorrow turn the page
