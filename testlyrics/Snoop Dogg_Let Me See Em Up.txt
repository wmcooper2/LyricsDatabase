I’m in the zone, lockin’ a lone like
Niggas keep talking’ but i’m sittin' on the phone like
Picking a bone like, sittin’ on my throne like
Niggas is wrong like, singing’ my song like
Nigga i’m so tight, rocking’ a gold mic
Walk through a dark cloud came out in a strobe light
Rockin’ a robe like, hef with his hoes like
Heavy is the head but to me its the soul like
Eat with the rich and get back to the low lifes
Cup with his cool-aid the flavor is so right
Dip it in floss like, ship it in one night
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life

Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low
Snoop Dogg
Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low
Aye, now thats whats up

I’m back in my zone like, living a long life
Stuffing’ the bone like, puffin’ a long night
Pingin’ the pong like, singing’ a song like
Godzilla forealla my killas is so right
If it don’t go right, make sure you all ride
Deuce deuce and a tec-9 with a 4-5
Niggas is so dead, my nigga i’m so live
Back in my zone like niggas hitting’ my phone like
Shoot him some bail like, cuz he won’t tell right?
The homies don’t act like, the homies don’t act right
Under interrogation becomes cooperation
Thats why I dealt like, solo and bolo like
Kick a little ass and talk shit like i’m dolomite
Dip it in floss like, ship it in one night
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life

Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low
Snoop Dogg
Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low
Snoop Dogg
Aye, now that's whats up

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low

Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low
