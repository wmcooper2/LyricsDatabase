This is the beginning of the end
I can see it in your eyes, in everything you do
And you're afraid to tell me that we're through
But I can tell by looking at you
This is the beginning of the end
You just give yourself away with everything you say
And though you never told me we must part
Still I can read the writing in your heart
Why is it now when I hold your hand
There is some little something that I miss
What has become of the warmth in your smile
And where is that little mischief in your goodnight kiss?
This is the beginning of the end
I can see the thrill is gone, why let it linger on
Why lie to me and say it isn't so
For when I hold you in my arms I know
That this, this is the beginning of the end
