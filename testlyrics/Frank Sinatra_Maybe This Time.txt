Maybe this time, I'll be lucky, maybe this time she'll stay
Maybe this time, for the first time, love won't wander away
She's gonna hold me fast, and I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore, not like the last time, and the time before
Everybody loves a winner, but nobody loves me
Mr. Peaceful, Mr. Happy, that's what I want to be
All of the odds are, in my favor, something's bound to begin
It's gotta happen, happen sometime, maybe this time I'll win
