It's only a papermoon, s
ailin'over a cardboard sea,
But it wouldn't be make believe, 
if you believed in me.

It's only a canvas sky, 
hanging over a muslin tree,
But it wouldn't be make believe, 
if you believed in me.

Without your love, 
it's a honky-tonk parade,
Without your love, 
it's a melody played in a penny arcade.

It's a Barnum and Bailey world, 
just as phoney as it can be,
But it wouldn't be make believe, 
if you believed in me.
