Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real, so bright
Ages ago, last night

Today, the world is old
You flew away
And the time grew cold
Where is that star
That shone so bright
Ages ago, last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now lets reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night
