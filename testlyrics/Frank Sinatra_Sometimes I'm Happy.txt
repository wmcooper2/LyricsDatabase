Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition, it depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sometimes I am happy other times I am blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the sky
If I can find that sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's because I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy, so happy when I'm with you
