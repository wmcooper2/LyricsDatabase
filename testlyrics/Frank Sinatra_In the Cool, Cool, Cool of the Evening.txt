Sue wants a barbecue, Sam wants to boil a ham,
Grace votes for bouillabaisse too
Jake wants a weenie bake, steak and the layer cake,
And he'll get a tummy ache too.
We'll rent a tent or a tee pee, let the town crier cry.
And if it's on a ditty, this is what I'll reply.

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, tell 'em I'll be there,
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, better save a chair.
Oh, when the party's a-getting a glow on, and singing fills the air,
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right,
You can tell 'em I'll be there.
