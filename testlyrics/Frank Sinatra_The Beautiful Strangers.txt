All the beautiful strangers who held me for a night
And fell down in the darkness on pillows soft and white
All the beautiful strangers, all in the afternoon
Who praised my flat little summer, and came back to my room
All the beautiful strangers, they spoiled me for a time
And they taught me neon's just as nice as afternoon sunshine
