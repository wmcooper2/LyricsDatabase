Blue skies, smilin' at me
Nothin' but blues skies do I see

Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things looking so right
Noticing the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things looking so right
Noticing the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, oh how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
