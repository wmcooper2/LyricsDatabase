Once, once I Loved
And I gave so much love to this world you were the world to me
Once I cried
At the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye
And then one day
From my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again
Now I know
That no matter what ever befalls I'll never let you go
I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away
Love is the saddest thing when it goes away
