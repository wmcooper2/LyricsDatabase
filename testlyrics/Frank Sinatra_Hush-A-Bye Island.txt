Close your eyes, my little darling, 'cause it's time to drift away
To Hush-a-bye Island on Rock-a-bye Bay.
Buy a candy-coated mountain, you have lots of time to play,
On Hush-a-bye Island on Rock-a-bye Bay.

You can take the Toy-Town Trolley and meet the jolly Times Express,
No one there is melancholy, it's an isle of happiness.
Don't you keep your dreamboat waiting, hope you have a pleasant stay
On Hush-a-bye Island on Rock-a-bye Bay.
