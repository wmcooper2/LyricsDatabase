Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine and the morning dew
Each thing depends on something 
And I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good, I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money or spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame baby, for what I do
I know that I can be a beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know dear 
You can help me on
Wouldn't it hurt to know dear 
All my hopes were gone
Wouldn't it make you proud dear
If I made a name
But if I failed to win dear
Would you want all the blame
