The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly.
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly.
The you and I came wandering by, and lost in a sigh were we.
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly.

I canÂ´t forget how two hearts met breathlessly.
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside,
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly.
