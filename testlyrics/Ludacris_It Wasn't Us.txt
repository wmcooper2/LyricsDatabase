[Chorus: x2]
They want to know why I hit like that, spit like that, 
Shit like that, maybe because I get like that, 
Kick like that, rip like that
They want to know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, 
Climb like that, 'cause the world is mine like that 
(Yours like that) mine like that

[Ludacris]
You can get your whole crews, even niggas that owe you
They ain't paid you shit you can drink some cold brew 
And throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip
You can come and find us, be right behind us and insert the clip
You hear something that went "clack" "clack" "clack"
Somebody went down but it wasn't us
You can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile
Get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes
You can even start eatin' good and smokin' good 
But you pressin' your luck and you say wha' 
Somebody went bankrupt shit but it wasn't us

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
You can go to the drawing board just start from scratch
All over again clean
Or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch 
But my niggas is the police
You can try to blame me or even try to frame me but I'll make bail now 
Somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque
CD's on rack after rack no more selling sac' after sac'
You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife
It was yours to earn but the records stores gettin' returns
Shit but it wasn't us

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
You could be 
Going on worldwide tours and see your face on every magazine
Or you can flip to channel after channel 
And see that ass on the TV screen
You can pay for expensive videos 
And have whole lot of big bootie hoes
But when the shit start coming to a close 
Shit but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man
And start thinking quick
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros 
And tell 'em to suck a dick
And you tell just to get these
And you tell just to pay the fees
And to pay their dues, and they catching those STD's
Shit but it wasn't us

[Chorus: x2]
