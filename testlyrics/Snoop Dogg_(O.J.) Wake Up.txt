[Snoop] Yeah man this s*** here gonna be bigger than the O.J. case 
[Tray Deee] What? 
[Snoop] His dick 
*laughter* 
[Tray Deee] Another blast from the Long Beach section 
Break gangsta s*** (Wake up) 
I thought these fools knew 

Verse 1: Tray Deee 
Out on the scout I'm about my papers 
'cause ain't nobody doin Deee no favors 
I'm tryin ta get major with minor risk 
Maximisin the minimum of time is spent 
on the heist, nice and easy believe me 
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy 
Keepin n****s in a headlock 
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson 
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one 
They slip and I'm bookin em 
F*** fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips 
Chips to the neckline 'cause I got a Tek9 
Check mine like a pimp-main ho 
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low 
I go up in ya like a skeleton 
So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I'm bailin with 

Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg 
East-side LBC 
is what I claim but my game is DPG 
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip 
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch 
Is money all that makes you move? 
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove 
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know 
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh! 
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..... 
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up....... 
Wake up, wake up wake up....... 
Get up, get up, get up...... 

Verse 2: Tray Deee 
I break fools off like lepresy 
If they dare, you stare when they next to me 
I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style 
Hard gangsta aim to represent til death 
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick 
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with 
The bare hand man sleeper 
I even banked up and shank motherf***ers in the *?penta?* 
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time 
so try me you're liable to lose on my line 
The 44'll be what cracks ya head 
'cause that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with 
I figured n****s gettin soft like jellatine 
So Doggy Dogg tell em all who we're sailin wit 

Chorus: Snoop Dogg 
East-side LBC 
is what I claim but my game is DPG 
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip 
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch 
Is money all that makes you move? 
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove 
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know 
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh! 
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..... 
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up....... 
I had to wake up, wake up wake up....... 
Get up, get up, get up...... 

Verse 3: Snoop Dogg 
Uh, gonna work that motherf***er and do the percolatin 
'cause Snoop Dogg came back with the head raider 
Al Davis's? Nah n**** Tracy Davis 
The Eastside Long Beach greatest 
Criminal with style and boy you love that 
Sit back relax and let me drop another rap 
but this one's for the sisters and not the hoes 
The ones who be groovin it on the step shows 
Let a n**** in, I ain't diss ya friend 
and like The Staples I make sure we do it again 
But don't blow a n**** up or show a n**** up 
and don't think a n**** sprung 'cause you know a n**** f*** 
Love is a house and you got the key 
so give it to a n**** like a D-O-double G 
I'm from the...

It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..... 
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up....... 
I had to get up, get up, get up...... 
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up....
