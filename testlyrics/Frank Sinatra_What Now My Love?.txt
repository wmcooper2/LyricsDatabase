What now my love, now that you've left me?
How can I live through another day?
Watching my dreams turning to ashes
And all of my hopes into bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walked the night, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my heart and my soul

What now my love? Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars, falling around me
Here's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love? Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on and on
No one would care, nobody would cry
If I should live or even if I should die

What now my love? Now that it's over
Nothing is left, my last goodbye
My last goodbye
