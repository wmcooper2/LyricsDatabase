The tables are empty
The dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song 
It's the tenth time you've heard it

That's the beginning 
Just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson 
In learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light
One after another
Won't help you forget her 
And the way that you love her

You're only burnin' 
A torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track 
For learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep 
The whole night you're cryin'
But you can't forget her 
Soon you even stop tryin'

You'll walk that floor 
And wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break 
You're learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd, those blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep
That whole night you're cryin'
But you can't forget her 
Soon you even stop tryin'

You'll walk the floor 
And you'll wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break
You're learnin' those blues
