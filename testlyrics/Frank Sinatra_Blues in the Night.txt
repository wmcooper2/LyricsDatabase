My mama done tol' me, when I was in knee-pants
My mama done tol' me, "Son a woman'll sweet talk"
And give you the big eye, but when the sweet talkin's done
A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing 
The blues in the night

Now the rain's a-fallin', hear the train's a-callin, "whooee!"
My mama done tol' me, hear that lonesome whistle 
Blowin' 'cross the trestle, "whooee!"
(My mama done tol' me a-whooee-ah-whooee 
Ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back 
The blues in the night

The evenin' breeze will start the trees to cryin' 
And the moon will hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

And take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong, and he's so right

From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds they might blow
I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night

Mmm ooh ooh ooh my mama was right, there's blues in the night
