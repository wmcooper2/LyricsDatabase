We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

We three, we're not a crowd, we're not even company
My echo, my shadow, and me

What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above

I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo
But where is the one I love

We three, we'll wait for you, even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me
