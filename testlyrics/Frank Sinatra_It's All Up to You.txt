(Connie Haines alone)
(Even Superman supports the good health plan)
(He knows what it will do, it's all up to you, it's all up to you)

Spread the health alarm to every town and farm,
And preach the good health view, it's all up to you, it's all up to you.

(You'll find being healthy means more than a well-filled hearse)
What good's being wealthy when you can't buy a doctor or a nurse.

(When the job is done), we'll wind up number one 

We need vitamins and medicines and beds to spare,
(Places where the sick can go and get some care.)

Lots of new equipment to combat disease
(Free examination for the kids and class,)

A kid whose health is good will have a chance to pass.
(If we do these thing and we will be the state)

Do your state a favor, the task is yours alone.
(Be a real life saver, and chance is that you will save your own)
Get in there, get yourself someone to help.
