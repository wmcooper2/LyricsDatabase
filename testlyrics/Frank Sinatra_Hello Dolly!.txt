Hello Dolly, well hello Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're looking swell, Dolly, we can tell, Dolly
You're still glowing, you're still crowing, you're still going strong
We feel the room swaying 'cause the band's playing
One of your old favorite songs from way back when
Take a rap, fellows, find her an empty lap, fellows
Dolly'll never go away, Dolly'll never go away

Hello Sax, this is Francis, Louie
It's so nice to see you back where you belong
You're back on top, Louie, never stop, Louie
You're still singing, you're still swinging, you're still going strong
You get the room swaying when you start in playing
One of your great songs, your songs from way back when
Blow your horn, Louie, sing up a great big song, Louie
Promise you won't go away, promise you won't go away
Promise you won't go away again

Oh yeah!
