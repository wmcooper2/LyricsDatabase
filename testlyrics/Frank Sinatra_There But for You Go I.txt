This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
