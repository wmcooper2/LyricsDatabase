You've seen him up and down the avenue
And now he's wearing the navy blue
She had a tear in the corner of her eye
As he said his last goodbye

Shoo, shoo, baby
Shoo, sh-sh, baby
Bye, bye, bye baby
Your papa's off to the seven seas

Do-on't cry baby
Do-on't sigh baby
Bye, bye, bye baby
When I come back we'll live a life of ease

Seems kinda tough now
To say goodbye this way
But papa's gotta be rough now
So that he can be sweet to you another day

Bye-iy-iy baby
Do-on't cry baby
Shoo, shoo, shoo baby
Your papa's off to the seven seas

Bye Bye Bye baby
Do-onâ??t cry my baby
Shoo-oo-sh baby
â??cos your papaâ??s off to the seven seas.
