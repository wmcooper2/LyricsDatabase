It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place 'cept you and me
Set 'em' up, Joe
I got a little story, I think you should know

We're drinking my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I know the routine
Put another quarter in the machine
I feel kind of bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad

I could tell you a lot
But it's not in a gentleman's code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it
But buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away

Well, that's how it goes
And Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close
Anyway thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear

But this torch that I found
It's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode
Make it one for my baby
And another for the road
The long, it's damned long, it's so long
