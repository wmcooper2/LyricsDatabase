Pretend there is no silence, alone in your apartment
Don't notice things that once were hers
Ignore the endless hours
Don't chase the dream that your hearts were after, children's laughter

Somehow believe in living, forget about the giving
Just tell your life it must go on
Run from yourself until you can't be found
But don't remember, refuse to remember
Forget to remember love
