That old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
And then the elevator starts it's ride

And down and down I go
'Round and 'round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

A flame with such a burning desire 
That only your kiss can put out the fire 
'Cause you are the lover I have waited for 
The mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Darling, down and down I go 
'Round and 'round I go 
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
Under that old black magic of love
