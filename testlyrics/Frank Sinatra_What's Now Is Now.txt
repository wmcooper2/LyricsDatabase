You should have told me when it all began
You should have told me long ago
Someday I know you're gonna find
Just one mistake is not enough 
To change my mind

What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again

And if the doubting faces made you go
It's only mine that matters now
Those looks will soon begin to fade
If you come back and show them all
You're not afraid

What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again

Now that you know how much I understand
You have no reason to be gone
And if you feel at all like me
Just let me know I'll make it like
It used to be

What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again

What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
