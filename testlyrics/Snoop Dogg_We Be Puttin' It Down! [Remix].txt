Word on tha streets, see it aint nobodies business
secret to keep, so keep heat incase things get deep
peace box is where it starts, scarred flesh and broke hearts
since a kid this is how we live, 
aint nuttin to look forward to
schools full of devils
the church don't work cuz all the lies that they tell us
ya'll it'll be hell before we get there
survivin guns and drugs and see 
if you can deal with this germ warfare thats endin us
they anti-christ, I'm anti-fair, anti-vice, anti-nice, anti-spice
up your life, I'll make you love it
cuz it's real and you bump it cuz it's tight
yeah, people make the world go round, and it's a gang
of us all gathered up in our game colors
man, these my gang brothas
what, you aint heard of us
you aint never ever heard the word murderer's
we make the news what it is
you ask what is this
we the reason why the police in business
so run up on us with your knife and your pistols
we'll plague your character with rifles and missils
I dropped my pack and drove my back to the eastside
smash in this coupe with my passenger Snoop.
