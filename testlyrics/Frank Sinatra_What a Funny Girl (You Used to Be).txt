You always looked a little out of place
All grown up with freckles on your face
We'd spend each night with company
Just you, the teddy bear, the dolls and me
What a funny girl you used to be

You always had a thousand things to do
Getting all involved in something new
Always some new recipe, the kitchen
Always looked like World War Three
What a funny girl you used to be

It was so good with you around
You always found a smile
Where smiles could not be found

I never ever met a person more sincere
You'd always listen with an open ear
You'd fall for lines so easily
Whatever they were selling you'd buy three
What a funny girl you used to be
What a funny girl you used to be
What a funny girl you used to be
