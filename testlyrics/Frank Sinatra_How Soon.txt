How soon the flame of love can die,
How soon goodnight becomes goodbye,
You're gone now and life goes on now,
And everything seems out of tune.

But time can bring a change of heart,
And love can make another start,
Someday, you may come back to me to stay
But who can say how soon,
But who can say how soon.
