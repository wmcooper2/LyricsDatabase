All our days, we searched for just one love, wait for that one kiss,
In a word, we spend our life just waiting to give our hearts away,
Searching all our lives for that special day,
And then one day you come upon a smile, unlike, unlike any smile.

In a word, the searching is done, you come upon the only one,
She stands there looking at you, simply says, how do you do,
And all the searching is through.

In a word, the searching is done, you come upon the only one,
She stands there looking at you, and simply says. how do you do.
And all the searching is through.
