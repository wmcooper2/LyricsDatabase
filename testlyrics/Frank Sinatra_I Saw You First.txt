(I saw you first.) Now wait a minute. (Nobody else is gonna get you)
(I saw you first.) Yeah, I mean it. (Nobody else is gonna catch you.)
(You smiled at me, that was my lucky break,)
(Gave you that double take, except to myself)
Quote (Oh Frankie!) unquote (You gave advice) I did?
(I suddenly found myself in clover.)
(I tumbled flat) You sure did. (that was the time that you took over).
(If someone else wants to try this love scene,) with me?
What do I tell em, baby? (Just tell them I saw you first.)
I'll try to remember that I saw you first. (Lay?) Baby I should have seen you sooner.
I saw you first. (Oh gee) think you could ever stand the crooner? (Uh huh)
You smiled at me, that was my lucky break, gave you that double take
Except to myself (What did you say?) That does it!
You gave it this, I was like a clown in clover,
And that first kiss, that was the time that you took over.
So if my other love affair should go and burst, remember I saw you first
