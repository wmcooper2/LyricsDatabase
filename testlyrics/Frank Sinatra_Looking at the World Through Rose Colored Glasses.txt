Lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now
Lookin' at the world and everything that passes
Seems a rosy hue somehow
Why do I feel so spry? 
Don't blink your eye
Needn't guess, I'll confess
Certain someone just said 'yes'
In a bungalow all covered with roses 
I will settle down, I vow
That's why I'm lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now

Oh yes, I'm lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now
Lookin' at the world and everything that passes
Seems a rosy hue somehow
Why do I feel so spry? 
Don't blink your eye
Needn't guess, I'll confess
Certain someone just said 'yes'
In a bungalow all covered with roses
I will settle down, I vow
That's why I'm lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now
Yes, everything is rosy now
