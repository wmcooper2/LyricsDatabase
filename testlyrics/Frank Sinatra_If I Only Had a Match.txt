If I only had a match then my cares I'd soon forget
All I'd need would be a match if I had a cigarette
If I had a cigarette I could watch the smoke rings curl
But I'd really be all set if I only had a girl

If I had someone like you to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow we'd know such sweet delight
We could raise a family and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be if I only had a match

If I had someone like you to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow we'd know such sweet delight
We could raise a family and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be if I only had a match
