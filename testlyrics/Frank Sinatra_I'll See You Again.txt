I'll see you again whenever spring breaks through again.
Time may lie heavy between, but what has been, is past forgetting.
Your sweet memory across the years will come to me.
Though my world may go awry, in my heart 'twill ever lie,

Just the echo of a sigh, goodbye.
All my life I shall remember knowing you,
All the pleasures that I found in showing you,
The different ways that one may face,

The changing light and changing shade,
Happiness that must die, melodies that must fly,
Memories that must fade, dusty and forgotten bye and bye.
