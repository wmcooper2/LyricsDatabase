A moment after dark around the park
An old-fashion gent comes parading
Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day
The Lamplighter's Serenade
