Some time ago
I wandered down into old mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenes meant "please love me
And I could say frenes
A lovely seorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenes
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenes?
Bsame tu a m
Bsame igual que mi boca te bes
Dame el frenes
Qui mi locura te di
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo ensearte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para m
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bsame con frenes
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es mas que amor frenes
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazn
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para m
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bsame con frenes
