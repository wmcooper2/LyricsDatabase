I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let her go
