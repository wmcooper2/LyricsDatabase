Close your eyes, my little darling,
'Cause it's time to drift away
To Hushabye Island on Rockabye Bay.

By a candy-coated mountain
You'll have lots of time to play
On Hushabye Island on Rockabye Bay.

You can take the Toytown trolley
And meet the Jolly Times express -
No one there is melancholy;
It's an isle of happiness.

Don't you keep your dreamboat waiting;
Hope you'll have a pleasant stay
On Hushabye Island on Rockabye Bay
