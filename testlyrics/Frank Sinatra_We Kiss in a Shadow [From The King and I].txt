We kiss in the shadow, we hide from the moon
Our meetings are few and over too soon
We speak in a whisper, afraid to be heard
When people are near, we speak not a word
Alone in our secret, together we cry
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight, and say to the sky
Behold and believe what you see
Behold how my lover loves me

We speak in a whisper, afraid to be heard
When people are near, we speak not a word
Alone in our secret, together we cry
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight, and say to the sky
Behold and believe what you see
Behold how my lover loves me
