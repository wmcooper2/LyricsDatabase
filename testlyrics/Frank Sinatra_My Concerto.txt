My concerto is a simple melody
As simple as the day we met
My concerto isn't meant for Carnegie
Yet once you hear it play, you'll never forget
I wrote it just for you with a feeling from within
For no one else but you could make such music begin
My concerto is a love song from the start
And when you hear my song, you'll hear my heart
