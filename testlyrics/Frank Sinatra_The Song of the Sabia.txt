I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back
That my place is there
And there it will always be
There where I can hear the song of the Sabia
I'll go back
I know now that I'll go back
I will lie in the shadow of
A palm that's no longer there
And pick a flower that doesn't groW
And maybe someone's love will speak the nigh
The lonely unwanted light 
That may bring me through the new day

I'll go back
I know now that I'll go back
They won't be in vain
All the plans I made to deceive myself
All the rose I made just to lose myself
All the love I made to forget myself
Those mistakes I made just to find myself

I'll go back
I know now that I'll go back
That my place is there
And there it will always be
There where I can hear the song of the Sabia
Of the Sabia
