You ain't been blue, no, no, no
You ain't been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, go 'long blues

I always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when the lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a soul that's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo 
I could lay me down and die 

You ain't been blue, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' that goes stealin' down, way down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, go 'long blues
