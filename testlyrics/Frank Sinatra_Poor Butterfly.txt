Poor butterfly
'Neath the blossoms waiting 
Poor butterfly
For she loved him so

The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful 
I'm sure he'll come back
By and by

But if he don't come back
I just must die
Poor butterfly
