[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rolling through the hood
Players watch me 'cause they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I'm shining I'm fresh ? bodies in the ?
Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna
Shine, shine, shine

Keep doing what you doing
It's ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are coming over
I really think you fly
Tonight's the night

[Snoop Dogg]
I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars in ya face in ya state
In and outta cars, interstate, win a date with one of my broads
But you gotta hate a bitch before she gets your dick hard
That's what shinin about and when you get the hoe
You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about
You want the presence of pimpin, I'm walkin while limpin
And holding on the drink that I'm sippin, I'm flippin the script an'
I'm sliding while I'm dippin my whip in, out of traffic
It's so drastic, boombastic, this shits a hit, Jadakiss
Matter fact nephew this bitch is a classic, pass this
Hey yo locie loc' let's blow some dope, better yet lets go for dough
Hoe for hoe, I'm so fa sho, and so low and sensational
You know how I do it

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rolling through the hood
Players watch me 'cause they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I'm shining I'm fresh ? bodies in the ?
Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna
Shine, shine, shine

[Female Singer]

[DJ Quik]
Now whats the haps on the bottle caps I want a snow bunny
I'm rick James bitch I got for sure money and I ain't hating for nothing
But it be so funny cowards be wanting see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nails and burbs while you got pounds of curbs, and one of us got a play
Basically around the burbs I'm fitting like a lego block, you bullshitting
While I'm sitting in an eight o drop, these suckers tell me keep it gangsta
But they don't know, when they ain't looking I be doing population control
Then I'm looking for a breezy with a whole lot of soul so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe
To not the jada with the ?, its the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his jewelry shining all through his clothes and little tigger's
In the back on the low, but I still shine though

[Chorus]

[Female Singer]

[Jadakiss]
Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that's deeper than rapping and rhyming
Success happens with timing, over here I'm doin low with the punk
When I'm over there I'm in the low low with my unc and all the bitches
Looking for us but I ain't looking for puss, right now ma I'm looking for cush
And I'm strapped with the pound and ? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused
I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffel bags out on the lawn
So much money my niggas be counting it wrong, so many hits
I can't keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And ya'll still hate but we still shining let's go

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin through the hood
Playas watch me 'cause they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I'm shinin I'm fresh ?? bodies in the ??
Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna
Shine, shine, shine

[Female Singer]
Keep doing what you doing
It's ya time and its ya shine

I hope you shine
The party starts tonight

Shine, shine, shine
