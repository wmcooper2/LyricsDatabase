When I stop loving you the way I do, 
There'll be no moon to shine, no sky of blue,
When our two lips no longer cling, 
There'll be no bird to sing, there'll be no spring.

When I stop wanting you, forever more, 
There'll be no ocean wave to kiss the shore.
This world will crumble, and the skies will fall, 
My heart won't speak at all,
When I stop loving you.
