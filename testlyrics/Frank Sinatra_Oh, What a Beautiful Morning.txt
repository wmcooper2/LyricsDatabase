There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, What a beautiful mornin',
Oh, What a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin'her eye.

Oh, What a beautiful mornin',
Oh, What a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, What a beautiful mornin',
Oh, What a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.
