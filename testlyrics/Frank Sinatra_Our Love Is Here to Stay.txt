It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but ever and a day
The radio

And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go
But oh my dear

Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble

They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
