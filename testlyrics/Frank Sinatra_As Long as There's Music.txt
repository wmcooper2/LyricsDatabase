As long as there's music and words of romance
The spell of a theme starts
You to dream there's always a chance
As long as there's music, whatever the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song
