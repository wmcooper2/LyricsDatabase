I'm walking behind you on your wedding day
And I'll hear you promise to love and obey
Though you may forget me, you're still on my mind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind
Maybe I'll kiss again with a love that's new again
 But I shall wish again I was kissing you
'cause I'll always love you wherever you go
And though we are parted, I want you to know
That if things go wrong, dear, and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind
So, if things go wrong, dear, and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind
