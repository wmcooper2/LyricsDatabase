Sleep warm, sleep tight, when you turn off the light,
Sleep warm, sleep well, my love.
Rest your head on your pillow, what a lucky pillow,
Close to you, so close to you all night.

Sleep warm, sleep well, let dreams within you dwell,
Sweet dreams of me, my love.
Close your eyes now and kiss me, and whisper you miss me,
Sleep tight, sleep well, sleep warm.
