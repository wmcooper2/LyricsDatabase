There's a satin sky above, it's in view in the blue, a bed for a velvet moon.
There's a mountain made of mist, featherbed in the glen, caressing the velvet moon.
I see the Milky Way her negligee a vision of sheer delight, filled with white,
And there upon her breasts a necklace of stars that enchant the night
(in Sinatra's broadcast of November 5, 1942, the song was interrupted)
