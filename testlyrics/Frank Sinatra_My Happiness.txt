Evening shadows make me blue when each weary day is through,
How I long to be with you, my happiness.
Everyday I reminisce, dreaming of your tender kiss,
Always thinking how I miss my happiness.
A million years it seems, have gone by since we shared our dreams.
But I'll hold you again, there'll be no blue memories then.
Whether skies are gray or blue, any place on earth will do,
Just as long as I'm with you, my happiness.
