The sky was blue, and high above, the moon was new and so was love.
This eager heart of mine was singing: "Lover, where can you be?"
You came at last, love had its day, that day is past, you've gone away.
This aching heart of mine is singing: "Lover, come back to me!"
When I remember every little thing you used to do, I'm so lonely.
Every road I walk along, I walk along with you, no wonder I am lonely.
The sky is blue, the night is cold, the moon is new, but love is old,
And while I'm waiting here, this heart of mine is singing:
"Lover, come back to me!"
