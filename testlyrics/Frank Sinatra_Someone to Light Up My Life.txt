Go on your way with the cloudless blue sky above
May all your days be a wonderful song of love
Open your arms and sing of all the hidden hopes you'll ever treasure
And live out your life in peace

Where shall I look for the love to replace you
Someone to light up my life
Someone with strange little ways
Eyes like a blue autumn haze
Someone with your laughing style
And a smile that I know will keep haunting me endlessly

Sometimes in stars or the swift flight of seabirds
I catch a moment of you
That's why I walk all alone
Searching for something unknown
Searching for something or someone to light up my life
