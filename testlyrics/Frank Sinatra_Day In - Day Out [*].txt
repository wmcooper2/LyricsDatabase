Day in, day out, that same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you, day in and day out
Day out, day in, I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain, come shine, I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes an ocean's roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt when there it is, day in, day out
