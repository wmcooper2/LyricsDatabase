You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be,
You got the power to hypnotize me

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
'Cause you do something to me
Nobody else could do

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do voodoo that you do so well
'Cause you do something to me
Nobody else could do
