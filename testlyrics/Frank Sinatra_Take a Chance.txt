Love may be a gamble or a lead pipe cinch,
Leave your heart in shambles, never give an inch
But however it goes, when it's under your nose,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.

Love may be a fire or a puff of smoke,
Moment of desire or it's go-for-broke,
But however it's planned when it closes your hand,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.

You may be the one in a million who's lucky to win that prize.
You may be the one in a million who gets it between the eyes.
Love may the ocean or a drop of rain,
Choosing as emotion or a constant pain.

You won't know what you've got till your heart is on a spot.
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love may be a double or a fate on balls,
Tiny water buffalo on Niagara Falls,

Though the cards in the game never turn up the same,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love may be a gravel or a two-ton truck
Regal as a sable or a Donald Duck,

But you must not avoid what is basic as Freud,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love is real devotion or it's inhumane.
Still without emotion or a hurricane

So remembering this, when it's close as a kiss,
Take a chance, take a chance on love,
Here's your chance, grab that chance, here is love.
