We ought to bake a sunshine cake,
It does more good than a big thick steak,
(Start with a tablespoon of trouble,)
(Then add a smile and let it bubble off.)
[We ought to bake a sunshine cake]
(It isn't really so hard to make)
Fresh tears upon the tomb of pleasure,
(Kind words you needn't use a major cut)
It's not from a recipe book,
You don't have to be a good cook.
(Or run to the oven and look)
[With such a simple dish, all you do is wish.]
[So why not bake a sunshine cake,]
Of course it may keep your dreams awake.
Friends say there's nothing like the flavor,
Don't wait to do your friends a favor,
[And for goodness sake, let's bake a sunshine cake.]
It's got vitamins A, vitamins be	
(Vitamins L-O-V-E)
If you're fat, it's for that,
(If you're thin, stuff it in)
[What's wrong if you get a lot of grin,]
[We ought to bake a sunshine cake.]
It's not from a recipe book
(You don't have to be a good cook.)
[Or run to the oven and look]
[With such a simple dish, all you do is wish.]
[So why not bake a sunshine cake,]
[Of course it may be your dreams awake,]
Friends say there ain't nothing like the flavor,
(Don't wait to do your friends a favor.)
[And for goodness sake, let's bake a sunshine cake.]
