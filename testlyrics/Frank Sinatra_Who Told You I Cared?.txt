Who told you I cared?
Who told you my secret?
A secret I've held in the depth of my heart now for years

Who told you I cared?
Who saw us together?
We met in a dream, in a dream where your vision appeared

Though I know it isn't right
We keep meeting every night
And your kisses make me feel that my dreams are, oh, so real

Who told you I cared?
Who broke the enchantment?
I ask you to tell me who dared, who told you I care?
