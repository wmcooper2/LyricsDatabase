(They've Got An Awful Lot Of Coffe Down In Brazil)
Way down among the Brazillians,
Coffee beans grow by the billions,
So they've got to find those extra cups to fill,
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.
You can't get cherry soda,
"Cause they've got to sell their quota,
And the way things are I guess they never will,

They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil,
No tea or tomato juice,
You'll see no potato juice,
"Cause the planters down in Santos all say No! No! No!
A politician's daughter,
Was accused of drinking water,
And was fineda great big fifty dollar bill,
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.
