To you I give all of my heart and my love, to you
To you I'll bring sunbeams from heaven above, to you
To me you're an angel and you mean the world to me,
I'll be forever yours,
Your smile made the clouds and the shadows on high take wings.
Your kiss was the real inspiration to greater things.
My dreams I'm so thankful and grateful that they came through,
I owe it all to you.
