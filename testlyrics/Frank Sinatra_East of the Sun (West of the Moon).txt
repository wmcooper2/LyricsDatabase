I wish that we could live up in the sky
Where we could find a place away up high
Live among the stars, the sun, the moon
Just you and I

East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night

We'll live in a lovely way dear
Living our love and pale moonlight
Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon
