You have the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that upturned chin and the grin of impetuous youth
I believe in you I believe in you
I hear the sound of good solid judgment whenever you talk

Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk
I believe in you I believe in you
And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart
I've but to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart

I take heart to see the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that slam bang tang reminiscent of gin and Vermouth
Now I believe in you I believe in you

I believe in you I believe in you I believe I believe in you
