Balmy breezes are blowing - each star in the sky is glowing
But I couldn't care less
Lovely night birds are winging - and filling the night with singing
But I couldn't care less

Oh how perfect the setting - but how do I start forgetting
I'm alone where we walked before
For without the warmth of your caress
It's a cold and dreary world - I guess

And I couldn't care less - unless
You could care once more
But I couldn't care less
But I couldn't care less

Oh how perfect the setting - but how do I start forgetting
I'm alone where we walked before
For without the warmth of your caress
It's a cold and dreary world - I guess

And I couldn't care less - unless
You could care once more
