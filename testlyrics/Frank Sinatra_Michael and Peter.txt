Michael is you, he has your face, he still has your eyes
Remember, peter is me, 'cept when he smiles
And if you look at them both for a while
You can see they are you, they are me

This spring we had some heavy rain, my summer it was dry again
The roses that we planted last fall climb the wall
I think the house could use some paint, 
You know your mother's such a saint
She takes the boys whenever she can, she sure needs a man

All those years I've worked for santa fe, never ever missed a single day
Just one more without a raise in pay, and I'm leavin'
And the air still has a country smell, and everyone is looking well
As far as anyone can tell, the sun will rise tomorrow

You'll never believe how much they're growin'
John henry came to cut the lawn, again he asked me where you'd gone
Can't tell you all the times he's been told, but he's so old
Guess that's all the news I've got today,
Least that's all the news that I can say

Maybe soon the words will come my way tomorrow
And the air still has a country smell, and everyone is looking well
As far as anyone can tell, the sun will rise tomorrow
You'll never believe how much they're growin'
You'll never believe how much they're growin'
You'll never believe how much they're growin'
You'll never believe how much they're growin'
