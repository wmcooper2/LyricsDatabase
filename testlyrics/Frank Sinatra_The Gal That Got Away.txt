The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder, suddenly you're a lot older
And all because of a gal who got away
No more her eager call, the writing is on the wall
All those dreams you dreamed, they have all gone astray

The gal who won you, she's run off and undone you
That great beginning has seen the final inning
I don't know what happened, its all a crazy game
No more - no more that all time thrill because you have been put though the mill
And never a new love will ever be the same

Good riddance, good-bye
Every trick of hers you are on to
But fools will be fools and where's she gone?
Where has she gone?

The road gets rougher, it's lonelier and it's tougher
With hope ya burn up, tomorrow maybe she'll turn up
There ain't no let up, live-long night, night and day

Ever since, since this world began
There ain't nothin' sadder than
A long-lost loser
Lookin' for his gal who got away

Please come back
Won't ya come back?

Mm, mm, mm
Mm mmmm
