It's been eighteen years since I've seen you in the streets
Your up for parole heard the word this week
My cousin Flip come at home damn it's been so long
Keep ya eyes on the bras, homie keep ya head strong
Seen in your packages, kite keep you straigh
Deep in this caleseri, fat 'till it date
So we can chop it up, so we can spread the ice and
The ties of no g's is for sure, you know I like it
This is a D.P.G. dedication
Is for my homies on parole or probation
And you can catch the case homie on vacations
It's for the rainy or so you just bang

To my young homeboy, we ain't never gettn' out
It's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught
One love, eastside, that's how we do wild
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless
We was out, we was rockin' yes
But guees what?, now we're rockin' Snoop Dogg
And every bitch in the click straight roll it

[CHORUS]
Hope that, we can be, be together real soon
I hope that, we can be, be together real soon

Just a little bit of gang in the damn thing
Let the heat around, bang, dogg pound gang sweing
Why with me, let me show ya how D.P. do G.C. that
That's Kurupt, Nate, Snoop
The homies might flash
Kick, pack, send it 'bout five above and pass
All I wanna do is D.P.G.
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
Bump it gettn' da high to the one two step
Make the whole spot stop, been hittn' the ball next
Me and Darren side by side
Make Snoop wild wanna front from behind

To my young homeboy, we ain't never gettn' out
It's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught
One love, eastside, that's how we do wild
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless
We was out, we was rockin' yes
But guees what?, now we're rockin' Snoop Dogg
And every bitch in the click straight roll it

[CHORUS]
Hope that, we can be, be together real soon
I hope that, we can be, be together real soon

Out up on the streets tryn' come on up
Got caught sleeping and got cut the hell up
Just tryn' to make some money in my rhymes
Chat up on baby then live right
Got me a room and a cup of lur
Raised on the street yes the school of our nuts
You better pay me, ready or not
Find the death bodies all on your block
You gotta get paid and that's on the real
Broke on the smoke, and you know how I feel
I miss the real gangstas and that's on the wheel
Got blacked up while chasing the squeel

To my young homeboy, we ain't never gettn' out
It's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught
One love, eastside, that's how we do wild
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless
We was out, we was rockin' yes
But guees what?, now we're rockin' Snoop Dogg
And every bitch in the click straight roll it

[CHORUS]
Hope that, we can be, be together real soon
I hope that, we can be, be together real soon
