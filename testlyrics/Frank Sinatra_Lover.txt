Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you - speak my name
Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame
Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel - with our bliss
When, two lips of coral - want to kiss

I say (that) the devil is in you, and to resists you - I try
But if you didn't continue - I would die
Lover, please be tender, when you're tender - fears depart
Lover, I surrender - to my heart
