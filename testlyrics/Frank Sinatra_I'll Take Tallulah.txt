Have you met Dolores? She's queen of the forest
Have you met Olivia? Her I'd gladly give ya
Have you met the queen, the rulah, Tallulah
For that gal Tallulah I would fight a duela,
I would climb a hillah, I'll paddle to Priscilla,
But this is getting sillah, I'm getting lots of thrillah, Tallulah
When she starts to lock on to a man to love she wants to fricassee
No one doing the hula, can do what Tallulah can do to me.
I have met Fatima (Fatima is a schemma)
I have met Marquita (Marquita is a cheeta)
I have met Jemima, she's a social climba
I have met Ophelia, she will double deal ya,
Just one girl is Trullah, I'll take Tallulah
