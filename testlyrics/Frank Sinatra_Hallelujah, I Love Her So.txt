Let me tell 'bout a gal i know,
She's my baby and she lives next door.
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up,
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup.
That's why i know, yes, i know,
Hallelujah, i just love her so.
When i'm in trouble and i got no friend,
I know she'll go with me down to the end.
Everybody asks me how do i know,
I smile a damn and say she told me so.
That why i know, yes i know,
Hallelujah, i just love her so.
Now if i call her on the telephone,
Tell her that i'm all alone,
By the time i count from one to four,
I hear her on my door.
In the evening when the sun goes down,
When there ain't nobody hanging 'round,
She just kisses me, and then holds me tight.
And tells me, baby, everything's gonna be alright.
That's why i know, yes i know,
Hallelujah, i just love her so.
That's why i know, yes i know,
Hallelujah, i just, i love her so.
That's why i know, yes i know,
Hallelujah, i just love her so.
