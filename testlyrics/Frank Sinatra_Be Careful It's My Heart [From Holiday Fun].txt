Be careful, it's my heart,
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.
It's not the note that I sent you that you quickly burn,
It's not the book I lent you that you never return.
Remember, it's my heart,
The heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take, to keep or break, but please, before you start,
Be careful, remember it's my heart.
Remember,
It's my heart,
This heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take, to keep or break, but please, before you start,
Be careful, be careful
Be careful it's my heart!
