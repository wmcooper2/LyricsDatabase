I found your lips tonight
But where do you keep your heart?
I found your arms just right
But where do you keep your heart?

It's very plain to see I'll never win you
Unless you long for me deep down within you

I looked into your eyes
To see if you really care
You took me to the skies
But where do we go from there?

Oh, it's been such a lovely evening
But darling, before we part
Please tell where you keep your heart
