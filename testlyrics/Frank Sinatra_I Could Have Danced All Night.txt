Could've danced all night, could've danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could've spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before
 I'll never know what made it so exciting
 Why all at once my heart took flight
 I only know when she began to dance with me
I could've danced, danced, danced, danced, danced all night
I could've danced all night, I could've have danced all night
And still have danced some more
I could've spread my wings and done a thousand things
That I've never done before
 I'll never know what made it so, so exciting
 Why all at once my heart took flight
 I only know when she began to dance with me
 I could have danced, danced, danced, danced, danced all night
