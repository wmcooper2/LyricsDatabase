Rich by popular demand
The wait is over homie
Yes it is
A town connect
Know the city gon' feel this
Damn right
Say Toob I know you see me
Say Chris
What up boy
I know both our pops
Lookin' at us

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddamn it we made it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to gs that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
Been talk about it for years and now we finally here

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

They say what goes up must come down
But I ain't reached my cruisee altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said look out for me
And see these expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in seeapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like whats up motherfucker!

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
So all we got is street cred and a cool building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from (answer that)
Jeffrey standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time goddamn good at it

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world
