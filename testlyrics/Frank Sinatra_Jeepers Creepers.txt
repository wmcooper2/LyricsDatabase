Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those eyes

Gosh all, git up
How'd they get so lit up
Gosh all, git up
How'd they get that size

Golly gee
When you turn those heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes

Golly gee
When you turn those heaters on
Woe is me
I got to put the cheaters on

Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize
Where did you get those eyes

How did they get that size
Where did you get those eyes
