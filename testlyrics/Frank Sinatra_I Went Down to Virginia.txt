I went down to Virginia and no one sent for me,
I went down to Virginia to see what I could see.
Well I found the horses that some of the gals took bets,
The spirits of the states are guaranteed high sets
So I stayed down in Virginia 'cause that looked good to me.

I went down to Virginia and I didn't know a soul,
No wonder folks befriend ya, their hearts are made of pure gold.

While the civic minded citizens are all so kind,
They feed you with you hook a fish on every line,
So I stayed down in Virginia, that's how much I've been sold.

So bless the day that brought me here,
And bless the folks I love so dear.
Well, brother, if you ever plan a coming this way,
You find the things that's just exactly like I say.

I stayed down in Virginia, Virginia USA.
Yes, I went down to Virginia, I went by my request,
No one needs recommend ya, 'cause you are a welcome guest.

Well, I never thought I'd find a place where I could be
Just happy as a jaybird in a cherry tree,
So I stayed down in Virginia, 'cause that's the very best,
So bless the day that brought me here,
And bless the folks I love so dear.

Why, I plumb forgot to mention 'bout the biggest deal,
My gal is named Virginia, that's Virginia real,
So I stayed down in Virginia, Virginia, Virginia, USA.
