If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
I've got a terrible case 
On Nancy with the laughin' face

She takes the winter and makes it summer
But summer could take some lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face

Have you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks, you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy with the laughin' face

Keep Betty Grable, Lamour, and Turner
She makes my heart a charcoal burner
It's heaven when I embrace 
My Nancy with the laughin' face
