Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started'in to hum
Still it's a real good bet
The best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe won't that be fine
You think you've seen the sun
But you ain't seen it shine

A wait til the warm up's under way
Wait til our lips have met
And wait til you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothing yet

The best is yet to come 
And babe won't it be fine
Best is yet to come, 
Come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait til your charms are right for these arms, to surround
You think you've flown before 
But baby you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait til I draw you near
And wait til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothing like it here

The best is yet to come 
And babe won't it be fine
The best is yet to come,
Come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine
