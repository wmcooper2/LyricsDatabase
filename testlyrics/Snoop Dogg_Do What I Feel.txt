Verse One: Kurupt, Daz 
Now here's the perfect niche to let it bubble and foam 
Wait these seconds then watch the microphone get blown 
It's the mischievous, lyrical genius on the loose 
and I pack the deuce deuce of some act right juice 
I'm in my own, space and time 
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind 
It's a clear blue sky and a clear blue day 
Foe a G from DPG to wear clear blue and gray 
I come I came, I am I ain't 
the nigga ya wants ta fuck with, get peeled like paint 
Bottoms up, nigga give it all ya got 
from the bottom to the top or get shanked get shot 
Provocative footage, of this lyrical abuse transgression 
from this infectious enemy, they on the loose 
And unstoppable, Daz 
My motherfuckin nigga from back in the past 
Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit 
with no way your climbin out, and this ain't the punishment 
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react 
with intentions to keep on mashin, strap to strap 
Is this my boundary from county to county? 
Your homies want to try to soak me like Bounty? 
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day all night 
Partyin like a motherfuckin now all night 
But uhh, simple as fact I been wantin to serve your whole fuckin crew 
Now whatchu want to do? (Hmm, whatchu want to do? Yeah) 
Load up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin 
You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin 
I gets to bustin (blaow blaow) you gets to duckin (blaow blaow) 
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin in the cut 
My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em 
I catch em and let em have it what's up, with my opponents 
I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one 
Forever I reign, top Dogg number one 
My rhyme ?to some inflanable? and Doggs that's untrainable 
Uncontainable, my mind state's so strainable 
Chorus: Daz, Kurupt 
[Daz] I'm a D.P.G.C. for life 
[duo] I do what I feel and, I do what I like 
(repeat 4X) 
Verse Two: Kurupt, Rage 
I hits it like shots, from the homey strap 
I smoke indo, and I sip Cog-nac 
Give a FUCK whatcha name is, I tell ya quick 
Face to face, punk you can eat a dick 
Cause you're all out of time, out of sight 
out of mind, somethin I wouldn't do without a nine 
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat 
Mashin all through the streets rollin wit some heat 
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day 
Daily survival tactics in L.A. 
I'm on point and alert 
with skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt 
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist 
Mentally known to cause motherfuckin dilemmas 
See me in black and beware 
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there 
Now here's the kickoff, as I'm about to rip off 
Rage is knockin lips off, travellin like a spitball, I hit y'all 
Right between the eyes, smack dab in the middle 
with my rhymes or my riddles, ain't got no time to fiddle 
faddle, dibble, dabble 
Gotta Rock like Fraggle 
I'm hittin so hard I'm leavin that I'm leavin em snaggled 
Like Leon Spinks this black cat's got ya jinxed 
Fuck around and you'll get chipped off like the Sphinx 
Think, about it, better yet forget it 
Uhh, play like En Vogue cause you're never gonna get it 
The style, the flavor, the flow, the so-lo-ist 
Hit you in a second, one two mic checkin 
That's my lethal weapon like a chain and ball 
I'm wreckin, shop, tech and, glock 
Not in my pocket, no need for cock and 
gauges just flip the scripts and rippin pages Rage is 
the amazin, trail-blazin 
Flows shavin like Norelco you can't let go, hell no! 
I'm that Lyrical Murderer 
Stranded on the Row with my ill type flow and uhh...
