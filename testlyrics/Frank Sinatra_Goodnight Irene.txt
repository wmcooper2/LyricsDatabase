Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight, goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.
Last Saturday night I got married, me and my wife settled down,
Now me and my wife are parted, I'm going to take another stroll downtown.
Sometimes I live in the country, sometimes I live in the town,
Sometimes I have a great notion, to jump into the river and drown.
