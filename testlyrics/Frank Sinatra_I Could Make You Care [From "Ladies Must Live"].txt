I could make you care if only you'd let me,
 I could make you care, you'd never forget me,
 I can't resist, I'd be a fool to try,
 I know if once we kissed, I could kiss my heart goodbye.
 I knew this was love the moment I found you,
 So I planned my life, it's built all around you,
 Give me this chance, darling if you only would,
 I could make you care, I know I could.
