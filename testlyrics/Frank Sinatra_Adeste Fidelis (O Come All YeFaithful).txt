O come, let us adore Him
Christ, Christ the Lord

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels!

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Oh sing, all ye citizens of Heav'n above
Glory to God
In the Highest glory!

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

O come, let us adore Him
Christ, Christ the Lord
