Love was like a song, a lovely melody
Our hearts would sing along in perfect harmony
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune

Each time our lips would cling, I heard a serenade
Of love and youth and spring forever to be played
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune

We used to dance instead of walk
We used to sing instead of talk
Why was our love song that used to be
Only the start of the blues for me

But songs are funny things, they never really die
And so my hope still clings that someday you will try
To just remember the words
For I still remember the tune

When lonely lamps are lit and midnight songs will start
One song I must admit still fills my hopeful heart
So please remember the words
For I still remember the tune
