Life will be a dream song
Love will be the theme song

Soon, the lonely nights will be ended
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended
When I'm with you who cares what time it is
Or what the place or the climate is

Oh! Soon, our little ship will come sailing
Home through every storm, never failing
The day you're mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon

Soon, a little cottage will find us
Safe with all our cares far behind us
The day you're mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon

Let's make that day come soon
Make it come soon
