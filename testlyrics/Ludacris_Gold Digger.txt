[Chorus: Bobby v]
She's dangerous,(Uh huh) super. (OK)
Better watch out she'll take ya cash.
She's a gold... digger. [x2]
She's dangerous (alright) super (uh huh)
Better watch out she'll take ya cash.
She's a gold... digger [x2]
[Luda]
Yeah, she's a money magnet, smell a dollar bill in ya clothes.
Gold digger signs from her head to her toes
You here me sayin no don't mess with this dress
She's out to get ya dough none more none less
She's lookin' for a prize, man you killin me
Actin like you don't see the dollar signs in her eyes
You want to nail done, and I help, too
Plus a diamond necklace, that's all on you
You still can't see it, yeah you are sucking it
If you do it homeboy man I couldn't be it
Hypmontised by her goodlooks?
Yeah maybe, but a victim for a good crook? Nope not me!
Consider yourself worn so you can stay.
Or you can stick to my rhyme and get the heck away!
Either way, go figure, she's a gold digger.
Gettin' close as your bank row grows bigger
[Bobby V]
She's dangerous, super,
Better watch out she'll take ya cash.
She's a gold digger..
She's a gold digger..
[Repeat Chorus]
[Lil' Fate]
You gotcha way witha beauty
A treat with a brain
When she look at you she only see "ching-ching"
Be around your neck,a mill around your arms
A championship ring, she must be a bowla hard
She turns on the leader, as soon as you need her
Unless you bite the bait, you look mighty thico
When money talks she talks like F.B.I
Ready to handcuff the right guy
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie.
Schemin on the way to money yo, well ya tried
Guess its a game now, gotta watch who you trust
Like her because, its only out for your books
Ye sir, she's all about being paid
At the end of everyday its a fine new grade,
What more can I say? But the wires up front
Better watch out, she'll leave yah with insuffiant
[Chorus X2]
[Bobby V]
She said fancy cars.
She said movie stars you better watch your back
Or She'll be spending up your cheque
Oh yeah. For the growin... boy stop
Will be rottin yo drop
She's a...Gold digga, gold digga, gold digga yeah.
[Luda]
She's dreaming schemin on a way to get your dough
She hit a lot of reelin now hit the flow, you just don't know
Because you got got and that's for show
[Lil' Fate]
Yeah she looks like a ma lip chik 
But don't do it unless you got dollars of risk
She's a pimpstress running my gamein the olympics prosedure.. somethin:P
Aha uh uh huh
[Chorus (Repeat till fade)]
