How much do i love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do i think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would i travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if i ever lost you, how much would i cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would i travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if i ever lost you, how much would i cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?
