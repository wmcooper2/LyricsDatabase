It started all over again
The moment I looked in your eyes
It started all over again
The thrill we can never disguise
The day that we parted, so broken hearted
Will never return again
Dreams I've delayed, promises made
Are starting anew, just for you

It started all over again
The moment I held you so tight
It started all over again
When we kissed away the night, till dawn's early light
Now were together, sweethearts forever
We'll build our romance anew
It started all over again
The moment I looked at you
