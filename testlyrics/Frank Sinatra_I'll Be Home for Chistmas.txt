I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Won't you please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree for me, for me

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
