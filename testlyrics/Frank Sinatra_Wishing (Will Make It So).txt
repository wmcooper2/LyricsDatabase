Wishing will make it so
Just keep on wishing and care will go
Dreamers tell us dreams come true
It's no mistake
And wishes are the dreams we dream
When we're awake
The curtain of night will part
If you are certain within your heart
So if you wish long enough, wish strong enough
You will come to know
Wishing will make it so
