Some other time
I could resist you, yes
Some other time
Not now

There is no rhyme
Now that I've kissed you
With all that is me
I thee endow

Imagine me thinking you could never phase me
The tricks my imagination plays me
You smile and this heart of mine betrays me
You know, it's so

Let's take a vow
True love forever
Not some other time
But now

Imagine me thinking you could never phase me
The tricks my imagination plays me
You smile and this heart of mine betrays me
You know, that it's so

Let's take a vow
True love forever
Not some other time
But now
