Wrong, would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this?
Would it be wrong to try?
Wrong, would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way?
Under the starry sky
If it is wrong, then why were you sent to me?
Why am I content to be
With you forever?
So, when I need you so much
And I have waited so long
It must be right
It can't be wrong
