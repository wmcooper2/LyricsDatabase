Since you've gone away, one thing is clear to me,
You were dearer than dear to me
From the moment you came.
Evenings by your side, I learned to love the night,
But the loveliness of the night
Is no longer the same.

When day is done and shadows fall,
I dream of you.
When day is done, I think of all the joys we knew
That yearning returning to hold you in my arms,
Won't go, love, I know, love,
Without you night has lost its charms!
When day is done and grass is wet with twilight's dew,
My lonely heart is sinking with the sun.
Although I miss your tender kiss the whole day through,
I miss you most of all when day is done.
Vesper bells are ringing, somewhere far away,
There's a silvery star away
At the edge of the sky.
Work is done, and life is like a song to me,
For some treasures belong to me
That no money can buy.

When day is done and shadows fall,
I dream of you.
When day is done, I think of all the joys we knew
That yearning returning to hold you in my arms,
Won't go, love, I know, love,
Without you night has lost its charms!
When day is done and grass is wet with twilight's dew,
My lonely heart is sinking with the sun.
Although I miss your tender kiss the whole day through,
I miss you most of all when day is done.
