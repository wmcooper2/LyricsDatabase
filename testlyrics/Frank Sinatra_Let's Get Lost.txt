Let's get lost, lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost, let them send out alarms
And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's tell the world we're in that crazy mood
Let's defrost, in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed, off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Darling, let's get lost
Let's get lost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed, off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Darling, let's get lost
