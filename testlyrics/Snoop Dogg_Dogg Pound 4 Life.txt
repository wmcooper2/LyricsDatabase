Busta ass nigga (busta ass niggas). Bitch ride on they ass. I be back 
in about 30 minutes. Get your ass in the car nigga. ?? 

Before I even step motherfuckers hit the deck 
I get's wreck with a tech so cash in like checks fool 
I fet's my own back in a strap 
But if it calls for that I got my nigga Kenny Mack (beeoitch) 
Swift as the wind the Mac 10 is in my niggas clutches 
So bust this we rush this punk ass nigga 
I knew he was a fuckin' punk 
So then I tapped Daz "go and pop the fuckin' truck" 
He steps back in with tech and I'm all puffin' on blunts 
Ready to get wrecked 
Even though I knew he had a Mac 10 on I gave a fuck 
And stuck the tech out the window ready to (let loose) 
Get (some gin and juice) and then tell Snoop to come scoop 
Check me out peep how all who withstand 
Step so quick and slowly sink like quicksand 
"Murder" that's what I be yellin' 
I'm peepin' ya people now two hoods the villain 
Wheather I'm a see a G or a B.G. 
Sportin' locs and a beenie tryin' to mad dog you can't see me 
Now I can bust a cap and split 'em up 
Or ready to get 'em up 
What's up with that Dogg Pound? Like nigga then I hit 'em up 
Now you know what's up with Kurupt (right) 
Niggas don't give a fuck I'm headed for the westside 

Now this spots owned by the motherfuckin' D.O. (double G) 
P.O.U.N.D. so I see no (other choice) but to roll with the homicide 
(For all this drama make you and your momma die) 

This is Dogg Pound for life 
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga I just don't give a fuck) 
This is Dogg Pound for life 
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga we just don't give a shit)
