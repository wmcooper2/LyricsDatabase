When Madame Pompadour was on the ballroom floor,
Said all the gentlemen, obviously, the madame has the cutest personality.
And think of all the books about do Barry's looks,
What was it made her the toast of Paree?

She had a well-developed personality.
And what did Romeo see in Juliet or Hero in Perriet, or Jupiter in Juno? you know!
Or when Salome danced and had the boys entranced,
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality.

You're quite a ladies' man just how d'you do advance, I know it can't be publicity,
Boys to Sinatra: The boys at Metro call it a personality.
Oh Frank you're awfully thin, just how did you begin,
To set the style in the swoon industry

He: I did it with my famished personality.
I know it's not the place for me to make this crack,
But I hear tell that Gable's back.
Boys: Frankie, here's a bromo, why, a Como (ow!)

We're grateful to the flock to where those bobbies sack 
Because without them we must agree,
We would never have made it with a personality.
