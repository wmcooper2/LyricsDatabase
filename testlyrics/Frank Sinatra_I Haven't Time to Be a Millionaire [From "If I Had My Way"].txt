By a country road wild roses grow that need my special care,
So I haven't time to be a millionaire
And a cheerful brook on a mountainside is sad when I'm not there,
So I haven't time to be a millionaire

And a friendly gang of robins are peeved when I forget
That I'm the second tenor in their quartet.
So with all the things I have to do, I'm very much aware,
If I wished for wealth it wouldn't be quite fair,
'Cause I haven't time to be a millionaire.
