It's art that made the mold
It's the difference between the big and the small
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Just as long as it comes from the heart

It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Just as long as it comes from the heart
Just put more heart into you voice
And you'll become the people's choice

Just make up your mind from the start
That the song's gotta come from the heart
Just make up your mind from the start
That the song's gotta come from the heart

Don't be afraid you'll make your grade
Why you can sing as good as Bing
That's why I say when you start
That the song's gotta come from the heart

It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Long as it comes from the heart
It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Long as it comes from the heart

I'll give 'em that
I'll give 'em this
I'll strut away
Boy! You can't miss!
Just put a star on my chart
they won't need this anymore!
Cause the song's gonna come from the heart

Don't work cheap!
On opening nights, your name in lights

Why we won't stop, 'til you reach the top

We'll order our meal a la carte
That's expensive!
If the song comes from the heart

We'll be tremendous!
If the song comes from the heart
Can't call up Gable
If the song comes from the heart!
H-e-a-r-t!
