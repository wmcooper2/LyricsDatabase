How can you forget moments in the moonlight,
Moments of a love that used to be,
As I stare in space, I still see your face,
And once again I'm lost in your thrilling embrace.
Though the spell is o'er, somewhere in the moonlight,
Mem'ries of your kiss will live anew,
And we'll meet, my love, as I keep dreaming of
Moments in the moonlight with you.
