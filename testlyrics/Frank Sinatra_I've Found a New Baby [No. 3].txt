Everybody look at me, 
Happy girlie, you will see, 
I've got someone nice, oh, gee! 
Oh, joy, what bliss! 

Just the treasure that I need, 
Pure as gold and guaranteed, 
Is he handsome? Yes, indeed! 
Let me tell you this: 

I found a new baby, 
A sweet honey boy, 
My fashion-plate baby 
Has thrilled me with joy! 

His new way of lovin' 
Has made me his slave, 
His sweet turtle dovin' 
Is all that I crave! 

Sweetest kiss, what a kiss, full of bliss, can't resist, somehow! 
Tells me lies, but he's wise, naughty eyes mesmerize, I vow and how! 

I don't mean maybe, 
I just had to fall, 
I found a new baby, 
A new baby, that's all!
