I've seen the look of a baby with a rattle
I've seen the look of a hero in a battle
I've seen the look of a heartsick turtle dove
But the look that leaves ya real shook is the look of love

I've seen the look of a jockey on a winner
I've seen the look of a fat man havin' dinner
I've seen the look of those spacemen up above
But the look that closes the book is the look of love

It's thunder, it's lightning, the gentlest breeze
It's friendly, it's frightening
And more surprising than an elephant's sneeze

I've seen the look every single blushing bride has
I've seen the look that the fellow by her side has
But there's one look that I'd give my life to see
We are locked in a wondrous embrace
And there on that fabulous face
Is that fabulous look of love for me

[instrumental-first two lines of last verse]
But there's one look that I'd give my life to see
We are locked in a wondrous embrace
And there on that fabulous face
Is that fabulous look of love for me

That's what I want to see
That look of love for me
