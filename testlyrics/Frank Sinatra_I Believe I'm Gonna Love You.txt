As the morning casts a thousand bits of sunlight
And they shine like diamonds on the morning dew
I believe that every single one is mine alone to see
And I believe I'm gonna love you
If it seems that there are special stars for lovers
And we see them scattered `cross midnight blue
I believe that out of all this world, there meant for you and me
I believe I'm gonna love you
I'll take you to a magic place where no one's ever been
Where there's carpets made of flowers, and music in the wind
If you wonder why I'm giving you these treasures
I believe that as we walk through time, the best is yet to come
As I believe I'm gonna love you
As I believe I'm gonna love you
