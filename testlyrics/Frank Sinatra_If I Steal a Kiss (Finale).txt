If I steal a kiss, dear, I'll surely return it someday.
If I steal your dreams, dear, I'll bring them back some way.
If I steal your moonlight, I'll bring it back more divine,
But if I steal your heart, dear, I'll keep it close to mine.
If I steal your moonlight, I'll bring it back more divine,
And if I steal your heart, dear, I'll keep it close to mine.
I'll keep it close to mine.
