I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones we used to know
Where the treetops glisten and kiddies listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear those sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
