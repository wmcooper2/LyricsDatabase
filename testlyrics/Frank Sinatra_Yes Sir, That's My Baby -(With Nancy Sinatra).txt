That's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now

Yes, ma'am, we've decided
No ma'am, we ain't gonna hide it
Yes, ma'am, you're invited now

By the way
By the way
When we walk up to the preacher
I'll say

"Yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now"

By the way
By the way
When we'll run into the preacher
I'll say

I'll say, "Yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now"
