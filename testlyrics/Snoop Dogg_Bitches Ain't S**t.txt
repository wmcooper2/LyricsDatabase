Ain't no need to ask shes a slave to the money and I'm the master

But how you gonna sue me child support
When you ain't sat down and wrote me a rap
See you cant?

So she can check the track, I toast? to that
You can catch him on the dance floor, I toss to this
And you know she ain't got no panties, I toss to that
Gooshie-gooshie-moshie-mooshie-push me-push me

[Chorus]

Puff puff pass it back
Doggy dogg with a classic rap, blazing sacks back-to-back
Imagine that
I'm trying to holla at shiniqua
Champagne for me and my peopa

Until the end of time, and will continue to shine
My games gettin' bigger, its a wrap. chuuch my nigga
