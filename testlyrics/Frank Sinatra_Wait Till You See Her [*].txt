Wait till you see her
See how he looks 
Wait till you hear her laugh.
Painters of paintings 
Writers of books 
Never could tell the half. 
Wait till you fill 
The warmth from his glance,
Pensive and sweet and wise. 
All of it lovely 
All of it trilling 
I'll never be willing to free her.
When you see her 
You won't believe your eyes 
You won't believe your eyes
