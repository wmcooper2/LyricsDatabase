And on that dawn just when the day was breaking
I saw your face everywhere
And on that morning, love was in the making
I heard your voice, I hear music, I've no care

Sunrise in the morning, stay awhile, you know that I'll
Be thinking of you now and everyday
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile
And never stray, you stay baby, I'll pray

On that sweet night I looked at moonbeams clearly
Moonbeams dancing in your eyes
And it was right I know I loved you dearly
I saw your face, I hear music, I've no care

Sunset in the evening, stay awhile, you know that I'll
Be thinking of you now and everyday
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile
And never stray, you stay, baby, I'll pray

Stay awhile, you know that I'll
Be thinking of you now and everyday
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile
And never stray, you stay, baby, I'll pray

Please stay, baby, I'll pray, oh, you stay
Baby, I'll pray, please stay, baby I'll pray
