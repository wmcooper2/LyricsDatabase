It's a lonesome old town 
When you're not around
I'm lonely as I can be
I never knew how much I missed you
But now I can plainly see
It's a lonesome old town 
When you're not around
I wish you'd come back to me

I never knew how much I missed you
But now I can plainly see
It's a lonesome old town 
When you're not around
How I wish you'd come back to me
How I wish you'd come back to me
