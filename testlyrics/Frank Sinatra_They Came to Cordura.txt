They came to Cordura, they came to Cordura,
In search of destiny as wand'rers have always gone.
And there in Cordura, somewhere in Cordura, the hand of destiny awaited a certain one.
Bring your hopes and dreams to Cordura, only if they dwell deep in your heart,
For the old men say, on each chosen day in Cordura,
They will bless your dreams or tear them apart.
They came to Cordura, they came to Cordura, and soon they're gone like all the rest,
But for him whose dream was blessed in Cordura, I found my love in Cordura.
