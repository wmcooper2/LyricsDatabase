I'd like to make your golden dreams come true, dear,
If I only had my way.
A paradise this world would seem to you, dear,
If only I had my way.
If I had my way, dear, forever there's be
A garden of roses for you and for me,
A thousand and one things, dear, I would do,
Just for you, just for you, just for you.
If I had my way, we would never grow old,
And sunshine I'd bring every day,
You would reign all alone, like a queen on a throne,
If I had my way.
