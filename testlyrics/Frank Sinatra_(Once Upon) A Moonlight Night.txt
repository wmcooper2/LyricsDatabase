Once upon a moonlight night
Two hearts blended
Love surrendered
With embracing arms
Remember

Once the dawn came into sight
Ears that listened
Eyes that glistened
Knew its charms

And with our first kiss
Our first tender sigh
A shower of moon dust
Fell from the sky

We'll always keep
The love light shining bright
That started
Once upon a lovely moonlight night

And with our first kiss
Our first tender sigh
A shower of moon dust
Fell from the sky

We'll always keep
The love light shining bright
That started
Once upon a lovely moonlight night
