Rose Ann of Charing Cross, I keep your mem'ry ever-bright
Rose Ann of Charing Cross, dressed in your uniform of white
There by my lonely bed, a lovely angel stopped and stared
"That's only thunder overhead"
And that's how we met

Rose Ann of Charing Cross, the rose you gave me never died
Rose Ann of Charing Cross, it knows one day you'll be my bride
And it will live till then, until that happy moment when
I know our paths will cross at Charing Cross again, Rose Ann
