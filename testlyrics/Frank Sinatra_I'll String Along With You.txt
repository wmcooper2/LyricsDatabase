You may not be an angel, `cause angels are so few,
But until the day that one comes along, I'll string along with you.
I'm looking for an angel, to sing my love so to,
And until the day that ones along, I'll string along with you.

For every fault that you have, say, I've got three or four,
The human little faults that you do have, just make me love you more.
You may not be an angel but still I'm sure you'll do,
So until the day that one comes along, I'll string along with you.
