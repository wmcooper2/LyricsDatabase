You're so right for what's wrong in my life.
You're as right as rain; how can I explain?
You just fill every void in my life.
Oh, so right for what's wrong.

Fingers reaching; searching for the touch
Of love's first meeting. something tells me that
You're right for what's wrong in my life.
You're as right as rain; how can I explain?
You just fill all the need in my heart.
Oh, so right for what's wrong.

You've changed my world into a Shangri-La.
Without a single word, I knew that you
Would right every wrong in my life.
Through the darkness of night,
You're my one shining light.
You're so right for what's wrong.
