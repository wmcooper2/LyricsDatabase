Come out, come out, wherever you are (come out, come out)
 I know, I know you're not very far
 How I wish you'd hurry `cause I'm inclined to worry
 These arms of mine are open, hopin' you'll appear
 Where are ya, dear?
 Come out, come out, wherever you are (wherever you are)
 Come out, come out from under that star
 Yes, and incidentally, (do ya mean) ment'lly I'm not up to par
So come out, come out, come out wherever you are
 Come on out, come out, wherever you are
 I know, I know you're not very far
 If I sound too eager, my love life has been meager
 I'm just about to blow up, so show up, will ya, gal?
 And be a pal
 Come on out, come out, wherever you are (wherever you are, you are)
 Take off (take off) take off from your Shangri-La
 I have tried relaxin', Jackson, but it's the final bow
 So come out, come out, come out wherever you are
 (So come on out, babe)
 Wherever you are (So come on out, babe)
 Wherever you are (So come on out, babe)
 Wherever you are
