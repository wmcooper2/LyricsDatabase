Gimme a little kiss, will you, huh?
Whadda ya gonna miss, will you, huh?
Gosh oh gee, why do you refuse?
I can't see what you gonna lose.
Gimme a little squeeze, will you, huh?
Why do you wanna make me blue?
I wouldn't say a word if I were asking for the world,
But what's a little kiss between a fella and his girl?
Gimme a little kiss, will you, huh?
And I'll give it right back to you.
