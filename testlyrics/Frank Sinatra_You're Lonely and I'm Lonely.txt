You're lonely and I'm lonely,
So why can't we be lonely together?
The night is young and while it grows older
We can't forget crying on each other's shoulder.
The sky's cloudy 'cause we're lonely,
But soon we'll see a change in the weather,
Two lonely hearts beating as one,
Can be miserable and still have a lot of fun.
