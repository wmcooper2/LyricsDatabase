Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay

And soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic, gay Granada
