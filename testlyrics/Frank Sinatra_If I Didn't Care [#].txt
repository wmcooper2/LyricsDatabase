If I didn't care, would I feel this way
If I didn't care more than words can say
If this isn't love, then why do I thrill
And why does my head go round and round
While my heart stood still
If I didn't care, would I feel this way
Would my every breath begin and end
With just your name
Or would I be sure that is is love beyond compare
Or could all these be true if I didn't care for you
