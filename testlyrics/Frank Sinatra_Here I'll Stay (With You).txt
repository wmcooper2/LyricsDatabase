There's a far place, I'm told,
Where I'll find a field of gold,
But here I'll stay with you;

And they say there's an isle deep with clover,
Where your heart wears a snile all day through.

But I know well they're wrong,
And I know where I belong,
And here I'll stay with you.

For that land is a sandy illusion,
It's the theme of a dream gone astray;
And the world others woo
I can find loving you,
And so here I'll stay.

For that land is a sandy illusion,
It's the theme of a dream gone astray;
And the world others woo
I can find loving you,
And so here I guess I'll stay.
