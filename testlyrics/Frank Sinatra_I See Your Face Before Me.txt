I see your face before me, crowding my every dream
There is your face before me; you are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are; I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes, and there you are always

If you could share the magic, yes, if you could see me, too
There would be nothing tragic in all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me

Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me
