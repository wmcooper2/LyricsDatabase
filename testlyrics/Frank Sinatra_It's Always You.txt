Whenever it's early twilight
I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star i see
It's always you

Whenever i roam through roses
And lately i often do
Funny, it's not a rose i touch
It's always you

If a breeze, caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If i hear, a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time i fall in love
It's always you
