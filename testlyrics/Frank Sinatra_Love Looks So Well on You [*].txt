Like moonlight looks on a country side
Like a rose that's silvered with dew
Like sunlight looks on a meadow
Love looks so well on you
Like children look on a carousel
All the joys they feel shining through
Like picnics look on a Sunday
Love looks so well on you
It's bright as the starlight in your eyes
With stardust in your hair
And oh, that expression on your face
Is one you should always wear
Everyday you grow even lovelier
Yes, you do, my darling, you do
I love you every day of your life
'Cause love looks so well on you
