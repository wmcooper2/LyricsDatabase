The charm of you is comparable to a Christmas tree with toys,
With little girls and boys when first they see the tree.
The thrill of you is comparable to the thrill I felt 
when I first learned the heart could sigh,
And you were the reason why, and yet, and yet if we two have never met,
I'd know your grace that warms a face that only the angels get, and
So comparing you with all of these things, is all that I can do,
Because they add up to the charm of you.
(musical interlude)
So comparing you with all of these things, is all that I can do.
Because they add up to the charm of you.
