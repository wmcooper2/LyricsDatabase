Hey drink up all you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The laugh and the drinks on me

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My poor old heart ain't gaining any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need i say that my love's mispent
Mispent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me

Pardon me but i got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I got to find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here

Excuse me while i disappear
