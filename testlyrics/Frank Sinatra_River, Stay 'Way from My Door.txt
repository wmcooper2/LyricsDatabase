You keep goin' your way - I'll keep goin' my way (I'll keep goin' my way, you keep rollin' your way)
River, stay 'way from the door
I just got (me) a cabin - you don't need my (you'll never need that) cabin
River, stay 'way from the door

Don't (you) come up any higher - I'm so all alone
Leave the bed and the fire - that is all I own (- and you can have that phone)
I ain't breakin' your heart - don't (you) start breakin' my heart
River, stay 'way from the door

(Stay 'way, get 'way, roll 'way, stay 'way)
(You dirty, old, muddy river, you)
(River, stay 'way from the door)
