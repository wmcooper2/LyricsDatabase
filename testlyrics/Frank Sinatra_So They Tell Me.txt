We were a wonderful pair, so they tell me,
We had a heaven to share, so they tell me.
Everyone says that we lived in a dream just yesterday,
It's strange how a beautiful scheme can fade away.
Our love was out of a book, so they tell me,
We had that far-away look, so they tell me.
And then heaven tumbled, and now we are through,
How in the world can it be?
I can't tell myself that it's true,
So they tell me.
