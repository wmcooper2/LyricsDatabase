It was a most romantic interlude
And we were in a most romantic mood
Our hearts were lost in reverie
I only knew you were close to me
 
The music stopped, but we were still dancing
Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love
