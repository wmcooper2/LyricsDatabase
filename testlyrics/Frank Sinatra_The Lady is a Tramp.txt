She gets hungry for dinner at eight 
She loves the theatre, doesn't come late 
She never bothers with anyone she'd hate 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

Doesn't like dice games with barons or earls 
Won't go to Harlem dressed in ermine and pearls 
WIll not dish the dirt with the rest of those girls 
That's why the chick is a tramp 

She loves the free, cool wind in her hair 
Life without care 
She's broke, but it's oke

Doesn't California, it's cold and it's damp 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She gets far too hungry, baby, wait for dinner at eight 
She adores the theatre, however does get there late 
She'd never bother with someone she'd hate 
That is why the lady is a tramp 

Doesn't like dice games with barons and earls 
Never makes a trip up to Harlem driving shining in Lincolns or Fords 
She won't dish the dirt with the rest of those broads 
That's why this chick is a tramp 

She loves the free, fine, wild, knocked-out, cuckoo, groovy wind in her hair 
Life's without a care 
She's broke, but it's oke

She  loathes California, it's cold and it's damp 
That's why the lady 
That is why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp
