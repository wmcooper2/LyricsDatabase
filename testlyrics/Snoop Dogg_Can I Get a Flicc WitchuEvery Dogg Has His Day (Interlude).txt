Well Lyssa Brisna, in San Francisca,
The cute lil sista with the fever blista,
Said that I dissed her,
'cause I wouldnt kiss her,
But I got her a picture and said I'd holla back witcha,
Hey, they say I'm like Mr. Bigsta,
All these moves that missed us,
Divide and twist us,
Revive, relist us,
Remind my listenas 'cause Im a minista,
Designed by ministas,
Cause these times is sinistas,
But I'm gonna finish tha grindin til its done,
Knives and silly clubs,
Hos and fake thugs,
Pimps, players, and all of the above.

[Chorus]

Come on everybody, lets rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass,
Come on everybody, lets rock this place

Oh we! Yeah,

For shizzle. Where was I?
Oh yes,
Spitting and flipped ya,
Thumbing through scriptures,
Straighten ya dentures,
Pigs wont pinch us,
Wenches miss us and they wanna french kiss us,
Pack the pistas,
Twist the twistas,
Roll with me on this Dogg adventure,
But you cant enta,
Without ya credentias,
And if ya get in, you might get a picture,
So ya down, go and get down,
Cause Huggy Bear is coming to yo town.
You don't wanna miss this,
This just like Christmas,
So make ya wish list,
And go and flicc this. (Preach!)

[Chorus: x2]

Go VIP with big D-O-G,
And see how gangstas do,
Once we get witcha we cant take pictures,
We came too far witchu,
Go VIP with big D-O-G,
And see what gangstas do,
Once we get witcha we cant take pictures,
We came too far witchu.

Keeping ya hot, the spot, hot,
Burn it up,
Shake what ya got, ya got a lot
