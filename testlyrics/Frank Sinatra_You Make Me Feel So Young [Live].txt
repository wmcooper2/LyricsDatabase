You make me feel so young
You make me feel like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
Such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I want to run and play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I
We're just like a couple of tots
Running around the meadow
Pickin' up all those forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna to feel the way I do, today
Because you make me feel so young

You make me young
You make me think that spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
I'm such a coo coo individual

The moment that you speak
I like to run and play hide and seek
I like to go and bounce the moon
Just like a big balloon

Because you and I
We are just like a couple of tots
Who are, running around the meadow
Snatching up all those forget-me-nots

You make me young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Like bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm going feel the way I do, today
Because you make me feel so
Man I just feel so
You make me feel so young
So young
