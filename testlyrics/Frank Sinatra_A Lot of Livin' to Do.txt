I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams,
Now it seems,
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
"can't we be friends? "
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong,
Not for long,
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
"can't we be friends? "
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry,
Heave a sigh,
And wonder why,
And wonder why? 
I thought I found the gal I could trust,
Watta bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
"can't we be just friends? "
