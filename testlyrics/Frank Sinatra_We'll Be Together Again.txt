No tears, no fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again

Your kiss, your smile
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinking with your heart
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be lonesome
Times when I know you'll be sad
Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad

Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not good bye
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be lonesome
And times when I know you'll be sad
But don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad

Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not good bye
We'll be together again
