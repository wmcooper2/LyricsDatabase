I'll be around no matter how you treat me now
I'll be around from now on
Your latest love can never last
And when it's past, I'll be around when he's gone

Goodbye again and if you find a love like mine
Just now and then drop a line
To say you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So, I'll be around when he's gone
Goodbye again 

Now and then 
Drop a line 
To say that you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So, I'll be around when he's gone
