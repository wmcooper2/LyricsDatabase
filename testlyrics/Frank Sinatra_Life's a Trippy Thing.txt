[Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air,]
Getting to it naturally, really getting there,
[Getting such a high on, loving what I do,]
I'm so full of happiness, my hope's on something new,

[Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering]
(remembering, remembering).

 (ding-a-ling)
[My pot is filled with flowers, my grass is bright and
green,]
My tears brewing in my cup, and still I make the scene.
[But just don't try to change me, I love the world I found,]
I've got to fly my own sweet way, and don't you shoot me down.
[hahaha]

 (remembering, remembering).

 (a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling).
Don't pity me, I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, [a ding-a-ling],
(ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling).
 ( ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling).
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, (ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling,
ding-a-ling).
Ha ha ha, that's silly.(ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling).
