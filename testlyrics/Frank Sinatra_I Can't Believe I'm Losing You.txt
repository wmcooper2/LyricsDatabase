Is this the way our romance ends,
I got the message when you said we could be friends,
My love was true, I can't believe I'm losing you.
We played a game, of give and take,
But I stopped playing when my heart began to break,
What can I do, I can't believe I'm losing you.

Wish I could erase every little phase of love that's in the heart of me,
Every little dream, every little theme, will always be a part of me.
There's nothing left for me to do,
We've passed the point of no return, and now we're through,
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you.
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you.
