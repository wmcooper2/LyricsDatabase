Yo, B (turn your speakers up, man)
Turn your speakers up, money!
Yo, God! (Yo, God? )
Yo, I got mad skills
Isn't that money?

New York, New York: big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me, like niece; to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherfuckers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates; there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mind state
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confucius; I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare; catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender as I enter
'Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction; react; this fact, not fiction
Telepathic addiction to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfuckers minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin'
Give a fuck; what's your name? What you claim?
Or why you came? Motherfucker, don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me 'cause I'm simply
Layin' hos lives empty; the invincible emcee

New York, New York: big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Too much, I serve too many people too much
It's too much; I serve too many people
And when I finish servin', ain't gon' be no sequel

Gimme a couple G's for every emcee I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless; oh, you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile; you're no kin to me
So how the fuck you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by don't get high; don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces, lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin'
The highest in intellect; try connectin' with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen throughout the war
Dips like a low-low with my verbal fo-fo
The cocoa complexion emcee with the slow flow
Fo' sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, corrupter; emcee to vocally
Bore your whole molecular structure
Catastrophic, mystic as mixelplix
Hittin' emcees like picks the deadliest lyricist

We live; tonight I serve two thousand emcees
We live 'cause can't none fuck with the DPGs

[Daz]
We live (baby) because tonight I serve two thousand emcees
We live (baby); none can fuck with the DPGs

[Snoop Dogg]
DPGC, baby
ABC the DPGs
Baby

Everyday I bust rhymes and recite
In ways that make emcees stop in daylight
I'm the deadliest emcee you wanna see on the streets
Invincibility is what makes me complete, compete
Nah, you can't even fade me
I fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady
