Let's take a boat to Bermuda
Let's take a plane to Saint Paul
Let's take a kayak to Quincy or Nyack
Let's get away from it all

Let's take a trip in a trailer
No need to come back at all
Let's take a powder to Boston for chowder
Let's get away from it all

We'll travel 'round from town to town
We'll visit ev'ry state
I'll repeat, I love you sweet
In all the forty eight

Let's go again to Niag'ra
This time we'll look at the fall
Let's leave our hut, dear
Get out of our rut, dear
Let's get away from it all
