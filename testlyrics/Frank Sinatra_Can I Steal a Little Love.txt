Can I steal a little love 
Can I steal a little love
Coo me honey I'm on fire
To steal your love is my desire

Hug me, squeeze (kiss) me, 'til I'm red
'Til my eyes bug out my head
Coo me, woo me, turtle dove
Can I steal (grab) a little love

(Please) Tell me, why are you driving me crazy
(And) Why do I dig you like I do
If I should steal a little kiss - and you can prove that it's (it was) wrong
(Hey/Honey) I'll give it back to you

Tell me honey with a smile
I can walk (will lead) you down the isle
I won't even need a shove
Can I steal (grab) a little love
