Let someone start believing in you,
Let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens
One someone who can look in your eyes,
And see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens
Cold, no i won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you,
And what magic you'll see
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you.
And what magic you'll see
Let someone give his heart,
Someone who cares like me
Let someone give his heart who cares like me
