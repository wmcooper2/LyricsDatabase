Two heads together are better than one in rainy or sunny weather
The outlook can't be a glum one when there's someone who cares
Just when you're sinking without a straw in sight
Someone starts thinking and everything's all right
Birds of a feather can never be shown that livin' alone is fun
When two hearts are better than one

Two heads together are better than one in rainy or sunny weather
The outlook can't be a glum one when there's someone who cares
Rain in the doorway can have its sunny side
When someone goes your way and her umbrella's wide
Birds of a feather can never be shown that livin' alone is fun
When two hearts are better than one
