I think of you, my love
Not as a stranger
Although it's true
My love we've only met

Yet I know your smile
And I know your sigh
Know them well from
Dreams I can't forget

We've kissed like this before
You are not a stranger
A thousand times or more
'Neath stars above

Now the path is clear
For at last you're here
Not as a stranger dear
But my own true love
