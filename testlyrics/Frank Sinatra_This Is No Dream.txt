This is no dream
That's what my heart keeps saying
This is no dream, this is real
Stars dance above,
Heavenly music's playing
This must be love the way I feel,
Here you are in all your loveliness;
This moment is divine, darling.
Your eyes just beam telling me loves old story;
This is no dream, you're really mine
