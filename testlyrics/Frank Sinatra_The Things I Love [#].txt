The glow of sunset in the summer skies, the golden flicker of the fireflies,
The gleam of love light in your lovely eyes, these are the things I love.
A silver moonbeam peeping through the trees, a bed of tulips nodding in the breeze,
The look you give in answer to my pleas, these are the things I love.

Oh, once I thought that Life was just a winter thing, my heart was cold, and then
You came to me and like a breath of spring, you turned the silver snow to gold!
A robin's serenade when day is through, a bubbling brook beside our rendezvous,
Your sweet voice whispering "Darling, I love you", these are the things I love.
