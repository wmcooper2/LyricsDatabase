Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting

Shimmering crowds and glittering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel
I'm home

Yes, it's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Lovers with empty hands
Oh, for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
In New York
