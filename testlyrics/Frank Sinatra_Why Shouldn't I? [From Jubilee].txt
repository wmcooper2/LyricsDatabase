Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by?
Why shouldn't I know of love?
Why wait around when each age has a sage who has sung
That upon this earth love is all that is really worth thinking of?

It must be fun, lots of fun
To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed
And then you'll be kissed again

All debutantes say it's good
And every star out in far Hollywood
Seems to give it a try
So why shouldn't I?
