A secret, a secret, he says I've got a little secret,
A secret, a secret, a secret kind of secret.
I' aching for to shout it to every daffodil
And tell the world about it, in fact I think I will.

If this isn't love, the whole world is crazy.
If this isn't love, I'm daft as a daisy,
With moons all a-round and cows jumping over,
There's something amiss, and I'll eat my hat if this isn't love.

If this isn't love, then winter is a summer,
If this isn't love, my heart needs a plumber
I'm swinging on stars, I'm riding on rainbows,
I'm busting with bliss and I'll kiss your hand if this isn't love.
