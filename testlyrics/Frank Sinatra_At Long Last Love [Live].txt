Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what i feel the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada i see or only Asbury park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?
