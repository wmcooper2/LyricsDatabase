Should old acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
And days of auld land syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For auld lang syne

So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you

For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For auld lang syne
