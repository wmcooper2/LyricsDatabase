When they met, the way they smiled
I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon
What did you do
And when they kissed, they tried to say
That it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon
Look what you've done
Once you promised me, you know
That it would never end
You should be ashamed to show
Your funny face my friend
(And) There they are, they fell in love
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon
You broke my heart
