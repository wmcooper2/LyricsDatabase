It's not that you're fairer
Than a lot of girls just as pleasin'
That I doff my hat

As a worshiper at your shrine
It's not that you're rarer
Than asparagus out of season
No, my darling, this is the reason
Why you've got to be mine

You'd be so nice to come to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise, to come home to and love
