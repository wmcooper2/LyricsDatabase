That's how it goes when you're in love with someone,
And someone's not in love with you.
It seems your heart and soul defy each frustrated desire
Of not seeing you, nothing I can do.
That's how it goes when you're in need of someone,
Who understands the way you feel,
But that's a dream that never will come true,
For that's life, that's how it goes.
