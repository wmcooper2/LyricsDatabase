I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses at the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say "I hope that you're much better"
And then I'll close the way I do

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you
I'm gonna smile and say "I hope that you're much better"
The I'll close "with love" the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and knock out a very large letter
And make believe it came
Although it's not the same
I'll make believe it came from you
