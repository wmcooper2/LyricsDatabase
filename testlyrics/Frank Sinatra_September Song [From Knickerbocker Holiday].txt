For it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
And the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And I haven't got time for the waiting game

And the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you

And the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you
