Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you (Repeat x4)
Look at my mind
Floating away

I know fuckin' with a crook is whack
I lied cheated still took me back
What I do, turn around, ask you to cook me crack
Boost my work with a jerk and tell the truth it hurts
Cause you even ask me to come through to church
What I do, act second rate
I stole ten dollars out of the collection plate
But I'm ready to change
You got my heart, plus you smart
And the sex is great
And you hate rap
I like that girl
I argue with Keisha, I ain't like that girl
You jumped, right out the car, to fight that girl
You be that (?) you ain't have to bite that girl
And my baby got the best thighs
And my whip she ain't never got to test drive
Copped here up, at five
You paid attention when no one acknowledge me
This is my public apology, Holla be

Hey baby lets get away lets go somewhere ah
Baby, can we
We can get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want we could do what you like tonight
Hey baby lets get away lets go somewhere ah
Baby, can we (where you want to go)
Where Italy, what Sicily, tell me girl, Disney world

He's the kind of guy that would say he baby lets get away
Lets go some place oh
Where I don't, care
He's the kind of guy that will give it everything and trust your heart
Share all of your love, till death do you part
I want to be what he wants, when he wants it
Whenever he needs it
When your lonesome and feeling love start I'll be there to feed it
Loving him a little bit more each day
Fears are at hold when I hear him say

You helped me work when we was twelve and a half
You said Cam, what the fuck dog, we twelve and a half
That house cost millions, twelve and a half
But I still got them (?), twelve in the stash
You can't even get mad
Say what the hell just laugh
Standin' there beautiful like what I'm gon do with you
You wanted me to go to school and just play ball
What I do, go to school with that (?)-ball
Here come the (?), here come the (?)
Yeah I dealt that, I'm a hustla though
I can't help that
You was there when I flipped my first birds
Now we gon see my son take his first words
And um, absurd, I ain't want to be no singer ma
I just wanted eight carrots on your finger ma
Since were young, you thug me I thugged you
You hug me, I hugged you
You love me, I love you
