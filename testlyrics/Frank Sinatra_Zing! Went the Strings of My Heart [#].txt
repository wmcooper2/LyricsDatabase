Never could carry a tune
Never knew where to start
You came along, when everything was wrong
And put a song in my heart

Dear when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me, started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring
Heard a robin sing
'Bout a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be, in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
I love you, I love you

I still recall the thrill
Guess I always will
I hoped thrill never depart
All nature seemed to be, in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
