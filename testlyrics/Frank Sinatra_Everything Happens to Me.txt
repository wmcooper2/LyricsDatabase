Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have roused the Devil's wrath
'Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party
But the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go thru life
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing,
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool
Who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought
You could break this jinx for me
That love would turn
The trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool
This head that thinks for me
So I've mortgaged
All my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
Sent an Air Mail Special, too
You answer was goodbye
There was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

I've never drawn a sweepstake
Or a bank night at a show
I thought perhaps this time
I'd won but Lady Luck said no
And though it breaks my heart
I'm not surprised to see you go
Everything happens to me

Everything happens to me
