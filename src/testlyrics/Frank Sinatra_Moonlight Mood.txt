Moonlight mood when twilight is ending
You're in my moonlight mood, and our hearts are blending
There comes the same old glow that we used to know long ago
You appear in a ribbon of moonlight
There you are, as lovely as ever
You vow by every star to love me forever
Although you're far away, we meet in my solitude
You are mine when I'm in my moonlight mood
There you are, as lovely as ever
You vow by every star to love me forever
Although you're far away, we meet in my solitude
You are mine when I'm in my moonlight mood
