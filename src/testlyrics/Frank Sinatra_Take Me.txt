Take me, I'm yours if you'll take me;
Please darling, awake me,
And set my heart aflame.
Hear me, I'm pleading for your love
I'm so hungry for love,
Can't you feel the same?
I don't ask for guarantee,
Promise me not a thing,
All I ask is won't you please 
Let me hear angels sing.
Take me, "tho you may forsake me, who cares
If you take me, and love me tonight
