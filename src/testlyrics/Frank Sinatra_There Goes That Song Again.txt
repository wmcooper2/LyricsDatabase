There goes that song again
We use to call our serenade
We fell in love when we heard it played
Over and over and over, over again

I still remember when
I sang the words and they made you mine
I'd steal a kiss and repeat each line
Over and over and over, over and then

We drifted apart, you walked off with my heart
It's funny how one listens, just starts me reminiscing
I'd soon forget that yen, I told myself
When you said, "So long", but I was wrong
There goes that song again
