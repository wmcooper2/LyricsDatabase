New York, New York
Start spreading the news
You're leaving today (tell him friend)
I want to be a part of it, New York, New York
Your vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray
And steps around the heart of it, New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
And find your king of the hill, top of the heap

Your small town blues, they're melting away
Don't make a brand new start of it, in Old New York
You always make it there, you make it anywhere
Its up to you, New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleeps
And find king of the hill one top of the list
A number one

These little town blues, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
Right there in Old New York
You allways make it there, You make it anywhere

Come on! New York, New York

New York!
