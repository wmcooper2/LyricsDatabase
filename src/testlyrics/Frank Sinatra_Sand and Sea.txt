Sand and sea, sea and sand
And the warm bright sun up there above
Summer days, happy days
With my love

Sand and sea, sea and sand
Hear the wings in flight of the lovely dove
Summer nights, happy nights
We were makin' love

The blinking stars are dancing on the whitecaps
Crazy stars, they've had too many nightcaps
I touch your hand, the hand that lies beside me
Paradise can't be far if you'll guide me

Sand and sea, sea and sand
And the angels sing from above
Happy days, hey, happy nights
Makin' love

Sand and sea, sea and sand
And the angels sing from above
Happy days, happy nights
Makin' love

We're in love
Oooh-oooh makin' love

Sand and sea
Sea and sand
