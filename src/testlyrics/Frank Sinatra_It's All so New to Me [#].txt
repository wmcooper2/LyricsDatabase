It's all so new to me to have you care
A lifetime of romance and joy that we can share
It's all so new to me, I can't believe
That this is love that lasts, enchanting and unsurpassed

Sapphire skies of blue and nights alone with you
The sun shines through the darkest day and finds us happy, oh so gay
It's all so new to me, it's such a thrill
To know that you belong to me and always will
