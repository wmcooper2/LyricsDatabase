The statue in the harbor is a lovely sight,
The Rockettes in precision are a sheer delight,
But I for one would rather visit John McKnight,
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa,
Meet me at the Copa tonight.
There are those who just adore the Art Museum,
And out in Brooklyn, there's a ballpark and it seems,
But I don't care a whole lot if I never zeem,
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa,
Meet at the Copa tonight.
The show goes on, and on, and on,
Do you hear the applause and the cheering,
Even if you're wooing, drop what you're doing,
Hurry down to see what you're hearing.
On 52nd street, they now have burleque,
And you count the effervescence and the view,
But all that stuff that squares is my advice to you,
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa,
Meet at the Copa tonight.
Now some of you may like to go to movie shows,
Or walk along Fifth Avenue to view the clothes,
But here's the place that's famous for geriatric nose,
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa,
Meet at the Copa tonight.
You'll see the nicest people in the nicest cars,
They constantly use the lounge across the lovely bars,
And it's the spot where stars come just to see the stars,
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa,
Meet at the Copa tonight.
The show goes on, and on, and on,
Do you hear the applause and the cheering,
Even if you're wooing, drop what you're doing,
Hurry down to see what you're hearing.
The most amazing club in town you will admit,
It's imitated quite a lot but this is it.
And if you want to see where the new acts hit,
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa,
Meet at the Copa tonight.
