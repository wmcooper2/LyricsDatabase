Someone said, drink the water, but I will drink the wine.
Someone said, take a poor man, rich don't have a dime.
So fool yourselves if you will, I just haven't got the time.
If you can drink the water, I will drink the wine.
Someone gave me some small flowers, I held them in my hand.
I looked at them for several hours, I didn't understand.
So fool yourselves if you will, you can hold out your hand,
I'll give back your flowers, and I will take the land.
And I will drink the wine.
Sometimes I'm very very lonely, there's only me to care.
And when I'm very very lonely, I want someone to share,
I'm going to drink the wine, I'm gonna take my time,
And believe in a world that is mine.
Someone gave me flowers, held them in my hand.
Looked at them for many hours, didn't understand.
Go on and fool yourselves if you will, you can hold out your hand,
I'll give back your flowers, and I will take the land.
And I will drink the wine, and I will take the land.
I will drink the wine.
