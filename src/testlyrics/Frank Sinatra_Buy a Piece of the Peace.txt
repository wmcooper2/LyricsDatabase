You get all, buy a piece of the peace,
Big or small, buy a piece of the peace,
Seven times before you bought the bonds we sold,
Victory isn't free, so trade it in for your gold.

This is it, buy a piece of the peace,
Do your bit, buy a piece of the peace,
Please, for freedom's sake, don't tease,
Come on and buy, come on and buy, come on and buy

A piece of the peace.
Take way down, buy a piece of the peace.
Go to town, buy a piece of the peace.
Just to say okay, no matter what the cost.
Listen friend lest you spend the things we won can be lost.

So be smart, get out and buy a piece of the peace.
Do your part, get hold of a piece of the peace,
There are lands we must police,
Come on and buy, come on and buy, come on and buy
