Strange music in my ears,
Only now as you spoke did it start,
Strange music of the sphere,
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?

You appear and I hear song sublime,
Song that I'm incapable of,
So dear, let me hold you near,
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange new music of love.
