Some people dress 'cause they dress when they dress
But he gets dressed to get dressed
(It's only a hunch but I bet you a bunch)
(He wears suspenders, a belt and a vest)
[From the tip of his toes to his head]
[He looks like an unmade bed]

You've either got or you haven't got style
(If you got it, you stand out a mile)
A flower's not a flower if it's wilted
(A hat's not a hat till it's tilted)
[You either got or you haven't got class]
[How it draws the applause of the masses]

(You either got, or you haven't got)
[Got or you haven't got] 

You've either got or you haven't got style (got or you haven't got style)
[If you got it, it stands out a mile] (if you got it, it stands out a mile)
With mother of pearl kind of buttons
(You look like the Astors and Huttons)
[You either got or you haven't got class] (got or you haven't got class)
How it draws the applause of the masses

(You've either got, or you haven't style) [got or you haven't got style}
(Style and charm seem to go arm in ar) [seem togo arm in arm]
[A flower's not a flower] (if it's wilted)
[A hat's not a hat till it's tilted]
(You've either got or you haven't got style) [got or you haven't got style]
[If you got it, you stands out a mile] if you got it, you stand out a mile
(Got it you stand out) got it you stand out a mile
