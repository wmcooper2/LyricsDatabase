Weep they will - will the lads down the street
When they find (that) you're promised to me
Weep they will - as their hearts lose a beat
At the thought you'll no longer be free
Oh smug, am I - warm and snug, am I
When you're close in my arms - just like this
It's so easy to see - they're jealous of me
There's so much love - they will miss
Weep they will - at the sound of the news
That we're seen all over the town
Eyes will fill - but they still will refuse
To believe that you've turned them all down
I don't blame them - I don't blame them
They've lost a sweet victory
And (Oh) weep they will - oh weep they will
When they find (that) you're promised to me
