I know there were a hundred ways to tell her I loved her
It's funny how they're all so clear today
And when her face was burning with sadness and yearning
I don't know why I turned my eyes away

[Chorus]
But it's so easy looking at the game the morning after
Adding up the kisses and the laughter
Knowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came
But then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game

The room was so alive with all her feelings and longings
I saw the spark of danger in her eyes
Well, how would it have hurt me if I'd turned back and held her?
A moment passes, something lovely dies

[Chorus]

Yes, it's easier to win it when you know you'd never play it quite the same
But then, this Monday morning quarterback never lost a game
