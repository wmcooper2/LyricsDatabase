Oh, if I had three wishes, my first would be for you,
And if you became my love, I'd return the other two.
Oh, if I had three wishes, I'd ask for you alone,
All the other things I want will be mine when you're my own.

But if you chose me, that I must use the other two,
It wouldn't matter, dear, cause here's what I would do.
If I had those three wishes, my first would be for you,
And the second and the third would be that my first wish comes true.
