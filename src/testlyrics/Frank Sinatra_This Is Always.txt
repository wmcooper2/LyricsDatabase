This isn't sometime, this is always
This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

This isn't just midsummer madness
A passing glow, a moment's gladness
Yes, it's love, I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always
