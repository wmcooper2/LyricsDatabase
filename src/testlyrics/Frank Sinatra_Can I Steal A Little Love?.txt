Can I steal a little love?
Can I steal a little love?
Cool me, honey, I'm on fire
To steal your love is my desire

Hug me, squeeze me, 'til I'm red
'Til my eyes bug out my head
Coo me, woo me, turtle dove
Can I steal a little love?

Please tell me why are you drivin' me crazy?
Why do I dig you like I do?
If I should steal a little kiss
And you can prove that it's wrong

I'll give it back to you
Tell me, honey, with a smile
I can walk you down the aisle
I won't even need a shove
