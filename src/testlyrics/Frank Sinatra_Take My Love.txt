Take my love, hold me tight, take my love, share this night,
Share my lips, share my heart, say that we'll never part,
Take my love, hold me tight, in its thrill find delight,
Let each kiss build a dream, let our love be its theme.
True love, fate for your hand, mine is the true love,
My anxious heart await your command.
Take my love, hold me tight, take my love, say it's right,
Say that you feel as I, say we'll love till we die.
