Oh, by Jove and by Jehovah, you have set my heart a flame
And to you, you Casanova, my reactions are the same
I would sing thee tender verses but the flair, alas, I lack
Oh go on, try to versify and I'll versify back

Well, let me see now, cherry pies ought to be you
Autumn skies ought to be you
Mr.Pulitzer's prize ought to be you
Romeo in disguise ought to be you

Columbine ought to be you
Sparkling wine ought to be you
All of Beethoven's nine ought to be you
Every Will Shakespeare line ought to be you

You are so enticing, I'm starting to shake
You are just the icing to put on my cake

You mean I'm yummy
Heaven's blue ought to be you
Heaven too ought to be you
Everything super-do ought to be you

Asphodels ought to be you
Orson Wells ought to be you
Uncles like Kip Cornell's ought to be you
Towels from Ritz hotel's ought to be you

Sweet Snow White ought to be you
Ambrose' light ought to be you
(Hey hey, that's good)
Eleanor wrong or right ought to be you
Errol Flynn loose or tight, watch it, ought to be you

You are so exciting,
I can't even laugh, wanna top that one
If you're fond of biting, I'll bite you in half

To continue
Whistler's ma ought to be you
Elliot's pa ought to be you
Everything hip-hurrah ought to be you

Ought to be you, ought to be you, ought to be you
Ought to be you, ought to be you, ought to be you
Ought to be you, ought to be you
