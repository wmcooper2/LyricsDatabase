Love
This is my song
This is my song, my serenade to you
The world

Cannot be wrong
If in this world
There is you
I care not what the world may say

Without your love there is no day
So love
This is my song
This is my song, my serenade to you

I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So love
This is my song
This is my song

My serenade
To you
