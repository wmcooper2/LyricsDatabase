I can't stop lovin' you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of old lonesome times
I can't stop wantin' you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
Yeah they make me feel blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
I can't stop lovin' you
Yes so I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of old lonesome times
I can't stop wantin' you
It's so useless to say
So I'll just live my life
Live my life in dreams
Of yesterday
