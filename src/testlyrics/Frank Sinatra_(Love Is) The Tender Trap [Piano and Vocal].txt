You see a pair of laughing eyes,
And suddenly you're sighing sighs,
You think nothin's wrong,
You string along,
Boy, then snap!
Those eyes,
Those sighs,
They're part of the tender trap!

You're hand in hand beneath the trees,
And soon there's music in the breeze,
You're acting kinda smart,
Until your heart
Just hoes Whap!
Those trees,
That breeze,
They're part of the tender trap!

Some starry night,
When her kisses make you tingle,
She'll hold you tight,
And you'll hate yourself for being single;

And all at once it seems so nice,
The folks are throwin' shoes and rice,
You hurry to a spot
That's just a dot
On the map.
You're hooked!
You're cooked!
You're caught in the tender trap!

Some starry night,
When her kisses make you tingle,
She'll hold you tight,
And you'll hate yourself for bein' single;

And all at once it seems so nice,
The folks are throwin' shoes and rice,
You hurry to a spot
That's just a dot
On the map;
And then you wonder how it all came about,
It's too late now, there's no gettin' out,
You fell in love,
And love is the tender trap.
