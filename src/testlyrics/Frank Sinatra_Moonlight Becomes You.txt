You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along
Moonlight becomes - it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you - I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight
You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't you tell me I'm wrong
What a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along
And if I say: "I love you" - I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight - although
Moonlight becomes you so
