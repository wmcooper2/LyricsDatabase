Pee-racticality dee-oesn't interest me.
Love's the life that I lead.
I've got a pocketful of miracles.
And with a pocketful of miracles,
One little miracle a day is all I need.

Tee-roubles more or less bee-other me, I guess,
When the sun doesn't shine,
But there's that pocketful of miracles.
And with a pocketful of miracles,
The world's a bright and shiny apple that's mine, all mine.

I hear sleigh bells ringing, smack, in the middle of May.
I go around like there's snow around.
I feel so good; it's Christmas ev'ry day.

Lee-ife's a carousel fee-are as I can tell,
And I'm ridin' for free,
So, if you're down and out of miracles...
I've got a pocketful of miracles,
And there'll be miracles enough for you and me.

(I hear sleigh bells ringing,)
Smack, in the middle of May.
I go around like there's snow around.
(I feel so good; it's Christmas ev'ry day.)

Lee-ife's a carousel fee-are as I can tell,
And I'm ridin' for free.
(I've got a pocketful of miracles,)
But if I had to pick a miracle;
My fav'right miracle of all is you and me.
