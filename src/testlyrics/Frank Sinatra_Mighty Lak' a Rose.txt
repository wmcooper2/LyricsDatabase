Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows;
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue,
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you.
When he's there a-sleepin' in his little place,
Think I see the angels looking thro' the lace.
When the dark is falling, when the shadows creep,
Then they come on tip-toe to kiss him in his sleep.
Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows,
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue,
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you.
