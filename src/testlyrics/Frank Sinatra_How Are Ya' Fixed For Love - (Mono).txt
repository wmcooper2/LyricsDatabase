How are ya fixed for moonlight ?
How are ya fixed for stars?
How are you fixed for kissin' ?
While we listen to soft guitars?

How are ya fixed for someone to watch the rain with?
To stroll down the lane with
For someone to just go a little insane with?
How are you fixed for memories?

Memories that shine so bright?
If we let fancy take us
We could make us a few tonight
How are ya fixed for someone who'll fit your arms like a glove?

Hey, tell me, baby, how are you fixed for love?

How are ya fixed for kissin' while we dig those wild guitars?
How are ya fixed for someone to sit and tan with ?
To worry and plan with?
For someone to dine right from out of a can with?

How are ya fixed for memories, memories that glow so bright?
Ooh, if we let Cupid rack up, we could knock us a few tonight
How are ya fixed for someone who'll fit your arms like a glove?
Hey, tell me, baby how are you fixed for

Tell me baby, how are you fixed for
Tell me, baby, how are you fixed for love?
