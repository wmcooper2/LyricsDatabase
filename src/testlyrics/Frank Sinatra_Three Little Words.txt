Three little words
Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days

And what I feel in my heart, they tell sincerely
No other words can tell it half so clearly
Three little words, eight little letters
Which simply mean I love you
