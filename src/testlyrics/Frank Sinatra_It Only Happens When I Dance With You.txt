It only happens when I dance with you
That trip to Heaven when the dance is through
With no one else do the heavens seem quite so near
Why does it happen here, only with you?

Two cheeks together can be so sublime
Especially when those cheeks are yours and mine
I've danced with hundreds of others my whole life through
But the thrill that comes with spring,
When anything can happen
It only happens with you.
