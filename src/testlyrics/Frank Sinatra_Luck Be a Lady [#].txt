They call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very unladylike way
Of running out

You're on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet before the evening is over
You might give me the brush

You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray

Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
How about you being a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And then blow on another pair of dice

Why don't we keep this party polite
Never move out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a lovely dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
But luck be a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair and it's not nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And then blow on another guy's dice

How about  we keep this party polite
Never move out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be a lady
Luck be a lady
Luck be a lady tonight
Tonight
