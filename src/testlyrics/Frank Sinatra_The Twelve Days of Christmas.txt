On the (first) day of Christmas, we gave our loving dad (my children gave to me)
Twelve dozen kisses, Eleven jars of jelly, Ten silken hankies,
Nine games of scrabble, Eight pairs of cufflinks, Seven books of fiction,
Six golden lighters, Five ivory combs,
Four mission lights, Three golf clubs, Two silken scarfs,
And a most lovely lavender tie.
