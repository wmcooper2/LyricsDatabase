In her sweet little Alice blue gown
When she first wandered down into town
She was both proud and shy as she felt every eye
And in every shop window she primp, passing by

Then in manner of fashion, she'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
Till it wilted she wore it, she'll always adore it
Her sweet little Alice blue gown
