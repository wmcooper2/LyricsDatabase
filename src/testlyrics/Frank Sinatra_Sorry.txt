(Woe, it's a lover's quarrel that they never should have started.)
(A dearly lover's quarrel, and it's left them broken-hearted.)
Oh, I'm sorry; can't you see that I'm sorry?
All my life I'll be sorry I was mean to you.
You're so dear to me; when you're near to me, the whole world seems fine.
Need you so...
I'm sorry; will you ever forgive me?
Heaven knows I'll be sorry if you say we're through.
Darling, I love you; won't you tell me you're sorry too?
I'm sorry.  (Take him back, oh, take him back, he didn't mean it.)
Will you ever forgive me?  (Take him back, oh, take him back, he never meant to hurt you.)
I'll be sorry... (Please forgive him, please forgive him.)
If you say we're through... (Take him back, and never say you're through.)
Won't you tell me you're sorry too?
(Take him back, oh, take him back, or maybe you'll be sorry too.)
