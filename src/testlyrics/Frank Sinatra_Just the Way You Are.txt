Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
Just us, just me
I've miss an awful lot, my trouble is you

Oh gee, what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot 'round wonderful you

Oh gee, what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot 'round wonderful you

Just us
