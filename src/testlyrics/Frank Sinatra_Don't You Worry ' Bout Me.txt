Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Be happy my love

Let's say that our
Little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day,
The sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
Should always be the rule
Give your heart and
Your love, to whomever
You love
Don't you be a fool

Darling why stop to cling,
To some fading thing
That used to be
If you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me
