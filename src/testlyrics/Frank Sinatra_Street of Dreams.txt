Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two, can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold up there on a moonbeams
Poor and nobody's poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
All the gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold up there on a moonbeam
Poor, and nobody's poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
