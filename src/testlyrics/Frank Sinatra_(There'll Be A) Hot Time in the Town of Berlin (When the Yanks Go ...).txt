There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
I wanna be there boy and spread some joy
When they take old Berlin

There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart and tear it down
When they take old Berlin

They're gonna start a row and show them how
We paint the town back in Kokomo
They're gonna take a hike through Hitler's Reich,
And change the "Heil" to "Whatcha-know-Joe"

There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
You could never keep `em happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin.

There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
Oh what a Jubilee there's gonna be
When they take old Berlin

There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart and tear it down
When they take old Berlin

They're gonna start a row and show them how
We paint the town back in Michigan
They're gonna take a hike through Hitler's Reich,
And change the "Heil" to "Gimme some skin"

There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
You could never keep `em happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin.
