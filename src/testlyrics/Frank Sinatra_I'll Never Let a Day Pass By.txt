I'll never let a day pass by without a prayer or two,
That heaven find a way so I might just run into you
Just to be near you and to hear you say hello
Would give an ordinary day a lovely glow.
I'll never let a day pass by but that I'll see your face
And thrill to every tender sigh while you're in my embrace.
I know it's all a dream but darling, if it were true,
I'll never let a day pass by without my loving you.
