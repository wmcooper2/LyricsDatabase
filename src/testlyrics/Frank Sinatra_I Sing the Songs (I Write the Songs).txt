I've been alive forever, and I sang the very first song,
I put the words and the melodies together, I am music and I sing this song:
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing,
I sing the songs of love and special things,
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry,
I sing the songs, I sing the songs.

My home is deep within you, and I've got my own place in your soul,
Now when I look out through your eyes,

I am young again even though I'm growing old.
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing,
I sing the songs of love and special things,
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry,
I sing the songs, I sing the songs.

My music makes you dance, it gets your spirit to take a chance,
And if the music's from the heart, it's a real fine way to start,
It's from me, it's to you, it's from you, it's to me,
It's a world-wide symphony.

I sing the songs that make the whole world sing,
I sing the songs of love and special things,
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry,
I sing the songs, I sing the songs.
I sing and the whole world sings,
I sing the songs of love and special things,
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry,
I sing the songs, I sing the songs. I am music, and I sing the songs.
