I'm doing all I can to separate your hate from me
It always seems to be the way you look at me
That gives it all away 

No one around you cares, about you or your sacred ways
They only see a sacred fist, they only see a bomb today 

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a place where patience can prevail
I believe in a thought that can set you free
And the seeds of hatred always fail
Loud 

In your mind you can't forget what evil has been done to you
It leaves in what you say or do and dictates your reality
But your soul is clean, disinfected by your innocence
And while it makes no sense, you pursue a slave's insanity 

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a sky where sunshine breaks the clouds
I believe in a thought that can set you free
In a mind that fears it's heartbeat
Loud 

But you won't let go because you're always right
And you won't say no, so you die tonight 

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a place where patience can prevail
I believe in a thought that can set you free
And the seeds of hatred always fail
I believe in a world that can take you high
In a sky where sunshine breaks the clouds
I believe in a thought that can set you free
In a mind that fears it's heartbeat
Loud (so loud)
