(Pass me by, pass me by, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by)
I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand,
Lots of idle fingers snap to my command,
A loverly pair of heels that kick to beat the band,
Contemplating nature can be fascinating,
Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth by gum have I
So tell the whole wide world, if you don't happen to like it,
Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by.

(I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand,)
(Lots of idle fingers snap to my command,)
(A loverly pair of heels that kick to beat the band,)
(Contemplating nature can be fascinating)
(Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth by gum have I)
(So tell the whole wide world, if you don't happen to like it,)
(Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by.)
(Pass me by, pass me by, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by.)
Behold me two great shoes that never saw a shine,
Houses I could hold up with a laundry line.
A loverly patch that hide an awful lot of spine.
Shirtails flying, I'm a blooming dandelion.
Add to these, a grin from ear to ear, all the proper gear have I,
So tell the whole wide world, if you don't like the thought of it,
Bail me out, thank you kindly, pass me by.
