The sky fell down when I met you
The green of the countryside has turned to blue
I have the moon right on my fingertips
And when first we kissed there were stars on your lips

To be with you just made it seem
That walking on snowy clouds was not a dream
You gave to me all this and heaven too
When the sky fell down and I met you
