One love will never die as long as I live,
One love will satisfy the stars that I give
One dream that only you inspire
Is the dream I pursue with all my desire.
How sweet the way you play upon my heart strings,
How strange when you're away, you give my heart wings,
And now you're in my arms and I know why,
You are and always be my one love.

How sweet the way you play upon my heart strings,
How strange when you're away, you give my heart wings,
And now you're in my arms and I know why,
You are and always be my one love.
