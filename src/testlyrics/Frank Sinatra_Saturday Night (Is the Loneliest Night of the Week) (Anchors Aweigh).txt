Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
'Cause that's the night that my sweetie and i
Used to dance cheek to cheek
I don't mind Sunday night at all
'Cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday go fast
And another week is past

But Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that i sang for the memories i usually seek
Until i hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

Mmmm... Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that i sang for the memories i usually seek
Until i hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

Until i hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
