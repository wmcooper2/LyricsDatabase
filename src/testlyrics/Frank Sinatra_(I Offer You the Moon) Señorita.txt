I offer you the moon set in a summer sky.
That is mine to give, senorita.
I offer you the breeze singing a lullaby.
That is mine to give, senorita.
I can't bring a golden crown set with pearls and rubies rare,
But I can bring a rose and place it in your hair.
I offer you these things that come from up above.
I give them and my love to you.
I can't bring a golden crown set with pearls and rubies rare,
But I can bring a rose and place it in your hair.
