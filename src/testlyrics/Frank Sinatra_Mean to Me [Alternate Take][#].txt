You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, baby, it seems to me
You'd love to see me cryin'
I don't know why I stay home
Each night when you say that you'll phone
You don't, and I'm left alone
Singin' the blues 'n' cryin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me whenever somebody is near
It must be
Great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't 'cause can't you see what you mean to me?
You treat me coldly every day in the year
And you always scold me whenever somebody is near
Gee, it must be
Great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't 'cause can't you see what you mean to me?
