How little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover

How little we understand, what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion, when two tingles intermingle

Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine 
How ignorant bliss is

So long as you kiss me, (and) the world around us shatters
How little it matters, how little we know
(How little we know, how little we know)
