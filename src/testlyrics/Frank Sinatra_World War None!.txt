Where I live in the desert, it's so peaceful and warm
And the cares of the world drift by, like clouds reflected in a quiet pool
But there always comes a time, when a man has to think of the future
(War, war, war!) Has to think of his children, (war, war, war!)
And the world they will live in (war, war, war, war!)
I'm not sure if I can do anything to help them, but I can try, I can try
Time to build us a fire, seven hundred feet high
We can fashion a fire (fire) that will reach the sky (reach the sky)
We can feed the flames with the unkind deeds we've done (with the fire)
'Cause we've got to get ready, for World War None
(What we want is to burn our sins in a sort of furnace)
(We'll be stoking the fire with the lies we know)
All our false suspicions we can burn them one by one
That will help us get ready for World War None
(A little love is more effective than a rifle)
(A little faith will take you farther than it can)
(The rule we follow is the one forever spoken)
(They haven't got the truth on their lips)
Keep on feeding the fire, till the fire is hot
With those un-neighborly feelings we deny we've got
Keep on trying for peace, until that peace is won
Then you're practically ready for World War None
(A whispered word or touch is louder than a bugle)
(A silent prayer is so much stronger than a sword)
(And the bombs that can't replace the stained glass window)
For which we should thank the good Lord, thank the good Lord)
(Thank you, thank you, thank you)
If we cherish our fire (if we cherish our fire)
It could possibly be (it could possibly be)
Bright enough to be seen, (bright enough to be seen)
Far across the...
