Sleep warm, sleep tight, when you turn off the light
Sleep warm, sleep well, my love
Rest your head on your pillow, what a lucky pillow
Close to you, so close to you all night

Sleep warm, sleep well, let dreams leave you a spell
Sweet dreams of me, my love
Close your eyes now and kiss me
And whisper you miss me
Sleep tight, sleep well, sleep warm
