Where are you?
Where have you gone without me?
I thought you cared about me
Where are you?

Where's my heart?
Where is the dream we started?
I can't believe we're parted
Where are you?

When we said goodbye, love
What had we to gain?
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain?

All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is my happy ending?
Where are you?

When we said goodbye, love
What had we to gain?
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain?

All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is my happy ending?
Where are you?
Where are you?
