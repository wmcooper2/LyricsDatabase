I know why I've waited, know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone exactly like you
Why should we spend money on a show or two?
No one does those love scenes exactly like you

You make me feel so grand; I'd like to hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish little scheme I'm scheming
And the dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why my mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you

You make me feel so grand; I wanna hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish little scheme that I'm scheming
And the dream that I'm dreaming
Now I know why my mother she taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you
