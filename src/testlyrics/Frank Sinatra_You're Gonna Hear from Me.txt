Move over, sun, and give me some sky
I got me some wings I'm eager to try
I may be unknown but wait till I've flown
You're gonna hear from me

Make me some room, you people up there
On top of the world, I'll meet you, I swear
I'm stakin' my claim, so remember my name
You're gonna hear from me

Fortune, smile on the road before me
I am fortune's child
Listen, world, you can't ignore me

I've got a song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up Clover
That's how it's gonna be

I've got a song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up Clover
That's how it's gonna be, watch me
You're gonna hear, you're gonna hear from me
