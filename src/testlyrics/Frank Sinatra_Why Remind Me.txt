(Why remind me) the way we used to talk and laugh,
I don't need any photograph to think of you [think of you],
(Why remind me) the way we danced the whole night long,
I don't need records of our song to sing it through.
I don't need books of matches to remember our caf.
What earthly good are matches to a flame of yesterday?
(Why remind me) I know our love has played its part,
I'm only asking of my heart to stop reminding me of you.

(What earthly good are matches) to a flame of yesterday.
(Why remind me I know our love has played its part,)
(I'm only asking of my heart) to stop reminding me of you,
It just keeps reminding me of you.
