When I walk through a jam, no one knows who I am,
Put your head on my chest, and I am Mr. Success.
Never closed me a deal, all at once I'm a wheel,
Just your head on my chest, and I'm Mr. Success.

Why I once knew a worrying man, he was a hurrying man,
With never a second to play,
He had appointments to keep, people to meet,
And it took her the hour to make him a day,

Not for me, not what I want to be,
Just your head on my chest, and I'm Mr. Success.

Why, I once knew a worrying man, he was a hurrying man,
With never a second to play,
He had appointments to keep, lots of people to meet,
And it took her the hour to make him a day,

Not for me, not what I want to be,
Put my love to the test, that's when I'm at my best,
'Cause with you, pretty baby, standing by my side,
I couldn't be a failure even if I tried,
Cause you make me Mr. Success.
