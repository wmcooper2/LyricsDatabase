It's over, it's over, it's over, I won't look back
Won't look back, my bridge has been crossed
It's over, it's over, it's over, I'll walk away
I'll stay away, cause my heart's been lost
Losing is not a happy thing when the stakes are high
Not when you lose your lover on a simple goodbye
It's over, it's over, It's over, I can't look back
Won't look back, my heart says it's done
It's over, it's over, it's over, but when I see her
And when I'm near her, I feel like it just began
Losing is not a happy thing when the stakes are high
Not when you lose your lover on a simple goodbye
It's over, it's over, it's over, I can't look back
Won't look back, my heart says it's done
It's over, it's over, it's over, but when I see her
And when I'm near her, I feel like it just began
