(SPOKEN)
DORIS: Gee, I'm glad you came over tonight
FRANK: Yeah! It'll be nice riding with the top down
DORIS: Oh, but I've spent the afternoon fixing my hair
FRANK: Oh, Oh!
DORIS: How about a movie, huh?
FRANK: No, it's too late for that, they'll be sold out of popcorn.
Say, I know!

FRANK:
Let's take an old fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told
If we went for an old fashioned walk

DORIS:
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled
May relax on an old fashioned walk
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
FRANK:
There's nothing like walking and having a heart-to-heart

BOTH:
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
FRANK:
She was wrapped up and sold
DORIS:
Coming home
BOTH:
From an old fashioned walk

DORIS:
Some couples go for a buggy ride
When they start caring a lot
FRANK:
Others will bicycle side by side
Way out to some romantic spot

(But when you haven't a sou)
(There's only one thing to do)

BOTH:
Let's take an old fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
FRANK:
What a tale could be told
DORIS:
If we went for
BOTH:
An old fashioned walk

BOTH:
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
FRANK:
And a heart that's controlled
DORIS:
Can relax on
BOTH:
An old fashioned walk

DORIS:
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
FRANK:
There's nothing like walking and having a heart-to-heart

(Walking and talking)

BOTH:
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
FRANK:
She was wrapped up and sold
DORIS:
Coming home from
BOTH:
An old fashioned walk

FRANK:
If your girl has declined
DORIS:
And won't make up her mind
BOTH:
What you need is a heart-to-heart talk

DORIS:
Take a stroll through the park
FRANK:
Down a lane where it's dark
BOTH:
And go for an old fashioned walk
