Oh luna rossa, you're out tonight,
A moon of red in a sky of white,
Because I'm selling a lie tonight,
And blushing moon, you know of it.

Oh lunna rossa, you're smart at love
You know I'm playing the part of love,
I try my hand in the art of love,
Just for the thrill and glow of it.

Luna rossa, forgive me, luna rossa,
For the vows I made tonight that are untrue,
What else am I to do?
But blushing moon, there's a reason why,

The love I longed for has passed me by,
And so I play at the game but I,
I am lonely, luna rossa.
Luna rossa, forgive me, luna rossa,

For the vows I made tonight that are untrue,
What else am I to do?
But blushing moon, there's a reason why,
The love I longed for has passed me by,

And so I play at the game but I,
I am lonely, luna rossa.
I am lonely, luna rossa.
