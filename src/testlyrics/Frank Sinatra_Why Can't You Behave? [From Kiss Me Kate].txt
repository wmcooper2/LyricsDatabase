Why can't you behave? Oh why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me
And those promises that you gave
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why can't you be good and do just as you should?
Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town
Where we two can go and try settling down
There I'll care for you forever
Cause you're all in the world I crave

But baby, why can't you behave?
I said,"I'll care for you forever"
Cause you're all in the world I crave
But why, why can't you behave? Baby I'm all confused
