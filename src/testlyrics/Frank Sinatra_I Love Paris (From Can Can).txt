I love Paris in the spring time 
I love Paris in the fall 
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles 
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles 

I love Paris every moment 
Every moment of the year 
I love Paris
Why oh why do I love Paris 
Because my love is here

I love Paris every moment 
Every moment of the year 
I love Paris
Why oh why do I love Paris 
Because my love is here

She's there, she's everywhere
But she's really here
