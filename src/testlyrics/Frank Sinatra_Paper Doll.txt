I'm gonna buy a paper doll, that I can call my own
A doll that other fellas cannot steal
And then the flirty, flirty guys - with all their flirty, flirty eyes
Will have to flirt with dollies, that are real
When I come home at night - she will be waiting
She'll be the truest doll in all this world
I'd rather have a paper doll, to call my own
Then have a fickle minded - real live girl
