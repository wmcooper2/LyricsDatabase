I've got you under my skin
I have got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I'd tried so, not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well 
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know, you fool
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 
And each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night 
And repeats how it yells in my ear 

Don't you know, you fool
That ain't no just win 
Why not use your mentality
Wake up, step up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop just before I begin 
Because I've got you under my skin
Yea, you grab me under my skin
