Dear face that holds no sweeter smile for me,
Were you not mine, how dark the world would be
I know no light above that could replace
Love's radiant sunshine in your dear face.

Give me your smile, the love light in your eyes,
I could not hold a fairer paradise
Give me the right to love you all the while,
My world forever, the sunshine of your smile
