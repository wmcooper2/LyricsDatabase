Give her sunshine in your smile
Give her pleasure all the while
Turn her thoughts from clouds of gray
Give her strength to face each day

Give her laughter be her friend
Stay beside her till the end
But, in giving all else above,
Don't forget to give her love

But, in giving all else above,
Don't forget to give her love
