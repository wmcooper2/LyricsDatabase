I feel the autumn breeze
It steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o' the-wisp
And in its song there is sadness because
There's no you

The lonely autumn trees
How softly they're sighing
'cause summer is dying
they know that in my heart there's no gladness because
There's no you

The park that we walked in
The garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall

In spring we'll meet again
We'll kiss and recapture
That summertime rapture we knew
And from that day never more will I say
There's no you

In spring we'll meet again
We'll kiss and recapture
That summertime rapture we knew
And from that day never more will I say
There's no you
