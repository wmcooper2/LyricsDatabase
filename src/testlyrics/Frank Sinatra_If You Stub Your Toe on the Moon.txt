Oh there's nothing to be ashamed of
If you stub your toe on the moon.
When the dream's at the top of the sky,
Well, you'll just have to jump pretty high,

But don't give up too soon,
If you stub your toe on the moon.
Now young Harry Hodgett loved making gadgets,
Life needs some new things was his claim,

Hope one or two things might bring fame,
This is the last time you'll hear his name.
Nobody mentions Harry's inventions,
But do you think that got him down?

Here comes the end when there're gadgets to mend
He's the best repairman in town.
So there's nothing to be ashamed of,
If you stub your toe on the moon.

When you start out to climb to a cloud,
Well, it may get a laugh from the crowd,
But don't give up too soon,
If you stub your toe on the moon.

Sweet Sally Springer, she was a singer,
Lived in a hall room up one flight,
Thought of the ballroom big and bright,
Where she would make her debut some night,

And then for her trouble, pop went the bubble,
Say that it's sad, but wait, don't weep.
Now they admit, every night she's a hit,
When she sings her children to sleep.

No, there's nothing to be ashamed of
If you stub your toe on the moon,
Though it may be a blow to your pride,
You're a hero because, well, you tried,

So don't give up too soon,
If you stub your toe on the moon,
If you stub your toe on the moon.
