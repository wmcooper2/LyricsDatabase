Don't throw bouquets at me, don't please my folks too much,
Don't laugh at my jokes too much, people will say we're in love.
Don't sigh and gaze at me, your sighs are so like mine,
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine, people will say we're in love.
Don't start collecting things, give me my rose and my glove,
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things, people will say we're in love.
Don't praise my charm to much, don't look so vain with me,
Don't stand in the rain with me, people will say we're in love.
Don't take my arm too much, don't keep your hand in mine,
Your hand feels so grand in mine, people will say we're in love.
Don't dance all night with me, till the stars fade out of sight,
They'll see it's alright with me, people will say we're in love.
