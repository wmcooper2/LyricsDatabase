Our Father, who art in heaven, hollowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those who trespass against us,
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,
For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever.
Amen.
