(Wonderland winter, wonderland, wonderland)
Sleigh bells ring are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, oh, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well in the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married? We say, no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

(In the meadow we can build a snowman)
And pretend he's a circus clown
We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Oh when it snows ain't it filling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Wonderland, wonderland
