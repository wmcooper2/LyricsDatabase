We have nothing to remember so far, so far,
So far we haven't walked by night and shared the light of a star.
So far your heart has never fluttered so near, so near
That my own heart alone could hear it.

We haven't gone beyond the very beginning,
We've just begun to know how lucky we are.
So we have nothing to remember so far, so far.
But now I'm face to face with you and now at last we've met,

And now we can look forward to the things we'll never forget.

And now we can look forward to the things we'll never forget.

No keepsakes have we for days that are gone,
No fond recollections to look back upon,
No song that we love, no scene to recall, we have no traditions at all.
