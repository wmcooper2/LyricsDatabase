Every night was long and gloomy, shadows gathered in the air
No one ever listened to me, no one wondered did I care
None in all the world to love me, none to count that stars that hung
Then the moon came out above me and I saw that it was young

I wished on the moon for something I never knew
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April day that would not dance away

I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two
Wished on a star and asked for a dream or two
I looked for ev'ry loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you
