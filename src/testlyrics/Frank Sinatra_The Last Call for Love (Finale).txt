It's the last call for love,
Time to say, "Fair thee well!";
Let the taps tell you all
That my heart dare not tell.

With your eyes in the stars of Old Glory,
Can I help but be faithful to you?
Till we meet on the day we're dreaming of,
It's the last call for love.

Till we meet on the day we're dreaming of,
It's the last call for love,
It's the last call for love.
