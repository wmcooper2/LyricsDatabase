Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love
Pale moon is casting shadows from above
Poinciana, somehow I feel the jungle heat
Within me, there grows a rhythmic, savage beat.

[Chorus]
Love is everywhere, it's magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care!

Poinciana, from now until the dawning day,
I'll learn to love forever, come what may

[Chorus]

Poinciana, from now until the dawning day,
I'll learn to love forever, come what may.
Poinciana!
