Oh, Bess, oh where's my Bess
Won't somebody tell me where?
I ain't care what she say
I ain't care what she done
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
Bess

My Bess, I want her now
Without her I can't go on
I counted the days that I was gone
Till I got home to see her face
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
I want her so, my gal, my Bess

Where is she?
Oh God, in your big heaven
Please show me where I must go
Oh, give me the strength, show me the way
Tell me the truth, where is she
Where is my gal, where is my Bess
