All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm just a mess without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Why don't you take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you

You know that you took a part that used to be my heart
So why not take all of me
