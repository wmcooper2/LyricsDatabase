let's go down by the grapevine
drink my dady's wine
get happy
down by the grapevine
drink my daddy's wine
get happy
happy
oh sweet blindness
a little magic
a little kindness
oh sweet blindness
all over me
four leaves on a clover
I'm just a bit of a shade hung over
come on baby do a slow float
you're a good lookin' riverboat
and aint that sweet-eyed blindness good to me
down by the grapevine
drink my dady's wine
good mornin
down by the grapevine
drink my daddy's wine
good mornin
Mornin!
oh sweet blindness
a little magic
a little kindness
oh sweet blindness
all over me
please don't tell my mother
I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover
come on baby do a slow float
you're a good lookin riverboat
and ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me
(don't ask me cause I)
ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
wine
of wonder
Wonder!
(by the way)
sweet blindness
a little magic
a little kindness
oh sweet blindness
all over me
don't let daddy hear it
he don't believe in the gin mill spirit
come on baby do a slow float
you a good lookin' riverboat
and ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me
good to me
now ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me
