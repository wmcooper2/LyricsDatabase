I'm feeling low, mighty low, I wonder why,
I wonder why, why am I such a lonely guy?
A man's a fool to be alone when the sun goes down,
You need a woman of your own, when the sun goes down.
If there's a gal in your arms, one you can love,
Someone who loves only you, then you'll never ever roam,
When the sun goes down, you'll always want to hurry home,
When the sun goes down.

(A man's a fool to be alone when the sun goes down,)
(You need a woman of your own, when the sun goes down.)
[If there's a gal in your arms, one you can love,]
[Someone who loves only you,] then you'll never ever roam,
When the sun goes down,
[You'll always want to hurry home,]
[When the sun goes down.]
I got my home, I got my horse and he's my pal,
But what's it mean, all of it means without a gal.
I got my horse, he's my pal and I got no gal.
