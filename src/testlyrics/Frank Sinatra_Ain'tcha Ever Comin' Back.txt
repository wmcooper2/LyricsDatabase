Ain'tcha ever coming back, aintcha?  Can't ya see the difference it makes?
I'm half myself without your kisses,
One more night of doing without `em will drive me crazy
Won'tcha make me smile again, won'tcha?  Just a word is all that it takes.
Your hello will let me know that we're the same as we used to be,
Oh, ain't cha ever coming back to me?
