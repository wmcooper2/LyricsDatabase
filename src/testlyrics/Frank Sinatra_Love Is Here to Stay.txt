It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but ever and a day

The radio
And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go

But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way

In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

The radio
And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go

But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way

In time the Rockies may crumble
And Gibraltar it may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love, our love is here to stay
