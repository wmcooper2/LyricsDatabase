Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends,
Never lovers ever friends.
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say.

I wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing,
And then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love.
And if you like lemonade to cool you in some lazy glade,
I wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love.
My breaking heart and i agree that you and i could never be,
So with my best, my very best, i set you free.
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, i wish you love.

I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, hot time, i wish you love.
All kinds of love, a whole gang of love.
