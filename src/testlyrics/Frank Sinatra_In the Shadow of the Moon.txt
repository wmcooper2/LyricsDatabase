In the shadow of the moon, there's a bright and shining place
Where two hearts can learn to share love beyond all time and space.
Though the candle barely glows through the haze,

Touch my hand, what it plays.
'Til a woman and a man learn to think and feel as one,
They must journey through the dark, then one day they'll find that sun.
We can own each silver star up above, simply love me, my love.

We can share the joy we're both dreaming of, if you'll love me, my love.
