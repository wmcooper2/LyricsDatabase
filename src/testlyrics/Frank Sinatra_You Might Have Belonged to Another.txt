You might have belonged to another,
We might never have met,
You might have chosen another,
For you are a much better bet.
You could have married a captain of a luxury ship at sea,
There was a wizard at polo was a socialized bee,
Remember the movie director who made five thousand a week,
And there was a diamond collector who had the same technique,
You knew a prince, a duke and a lord,
You had your choice of the three,
You might have belonged to another,
By luck you settled for me.
