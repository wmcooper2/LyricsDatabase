A heart that's true, there are such things
A dream for two, there are such things
Someone to whisper "Darling you're my guiding star"
Not caring what you own but just what you are

A peaceful sky, there are such things
A rainbow high where heaven sings
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star because there are such things

So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star because there are such things
