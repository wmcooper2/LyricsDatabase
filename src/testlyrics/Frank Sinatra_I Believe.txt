I believe, I believe
I believe in wishing wells
And I also believe in a lot of things
Things the daisy tells
I believe, I believe that a four-leaf clover brings
Lots of luck, lots of joy, lots of happiness
I believe those things
And when it's Christmas time I believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe, I guess that I believe because

I believe, I do believe
I believe that dreams come true
If you wish for a dream by a wishing well
Don't tell the wish or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive, but that's what I believe

And when it's Christmas time I believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe, I guess that I believe because

I believe, I believe
I believe that dreams come true
If you wish for a dream by a wishing well
Don't you tell the wish or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive, but that's what
That's what I believe
