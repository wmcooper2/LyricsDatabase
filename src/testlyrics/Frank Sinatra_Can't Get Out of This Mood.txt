All day long before my eyes come little visions of you.
They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do, they do.
And I can't get out of this mood, can't get over this feeling
Can't get out of this mood, last night your lips were too appealing
The thrill should have been all gone by today in the usual way
But it's only your arms I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream, what a fool I was to dream of you
Wasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm sayin' it, I'm playin' it dumb
Can't get out of this mood, heartbreak, here I come
The thrill should have been all gone by today in the usual way
But it's only your arms I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream, what a fool I was to dream of you
Wasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm sayin' it, yes, I'm playin' it dumb
Can't get out of this mood, heartbreak, here I come
This mood, can't get out of this mood, can't get out of this mood
