You're breaking my heart all over again.
Oh why did we start all over again?
It's too late now to wish I had never met you.
I've loved you much too much to just forget you.

If we ever part all over again,
Will I fall in love, no never again!
You said you'd love me, you made a vow,
Look what you're doing now,
You're breaking my heart all over again.
