Before we say good-bye forever, come waltz with me, come waltz with me - once more
Before we let love die forever, come waltz with me, the way we waltzed - before
Before our little world, just crumbled and fell
And tumbled, like a house of cards - to the floor
Before I'm left to sigh forever, and haunt the past - give me this last - encore
Oh darling come and waltz with me - once more
