You're part of my heart
And now that you've gone
The stars refuse to shine
Oh, how could they glow
When all of them know
That you're no longer mine

You're part of my heart
And I won't believe
That you've forgotten me
Those nights in the lane
Your love was so plain
You can't ignore my plea

My world is filled with loneliness
Now that you've said we're through
I'm sure that we were meant to be
But how can I prove it to you

You're part of my heart
My love will go on until eternity
You reign in my soul beyond my control
Forever part of me

It's 'cause you're part of my heart
Now you're gone
And the stars refuse to shine
Say, how could they glow
You know they know
You're gone
And you're no longer mine

You're part of my heart
And I won't believe
That you've forgotten me
Those nights in the lane
Your love was so plain
You can't ignore my plea

My world is filled with loneliness
Now that we've said we're through
I'm sure that we were meant to be
But how can I prove it to you

You're part of my heart
My love will go on until eternity
You reign in my soul beyond my control
Forever part of me, you're part of my heart
Part of my heart
