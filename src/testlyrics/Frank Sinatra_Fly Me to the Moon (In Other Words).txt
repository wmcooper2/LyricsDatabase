Fly me to the moon
Let me play up there with those stars
Let me see what life is like on
A-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Why don't you fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
Because you are all I worship 
All I long for and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words
In other words
I love you
