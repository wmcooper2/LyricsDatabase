In my loneliness
When you're gone and I'm all by myself 
And I need your caress
I just think of you 
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay
I just close my eyes 
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings
Yes, I love you so 
And that for me is all I need to know
I will wait for you 
Till the sun falls from out of the sky 
For what else can I do
I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be 
When you come back to me
