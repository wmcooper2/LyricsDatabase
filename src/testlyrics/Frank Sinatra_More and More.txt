More and more this heart of mine confesses
More and more I'm caught in your caresses
Warmed by the breath of your sighs
Cooled by the blue of your eyes

More and more I find it more than thrilling
To share this dream that needed fulfilling
More and more I'm less and less willing
To give up wanting more and more of you
