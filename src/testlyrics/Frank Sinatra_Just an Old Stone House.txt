Where do you live? in a brown-stone or an apartment house, a thousand feet tall?
Where do you live? in a penthouse? well, to be honest, I don't envy you at all.
'Cause I have a house, far from the city, it may be my own fault, but it's awful pretty.
Just an old stone house by a river, with an old dirt road running by,
There's a tabby cat and a welcome mat, and a blessed sun in the sky.
Just an old stone house by a river, with a few good friends dropping in,

There's some big old tree, and a gentle breeze and a little boy with a grin.
Oh yes, this is the place for me, oh yes, this is the place to be,
The valley and the flowers, the long peaceful hours, and beauty for any eye to see.
Just an old stone house by a river, and the door without any key,
Just a friendly place for a friendly face, just an old stone house and me.
Just a friendly place for a friendly face, just an old stone house and me.
