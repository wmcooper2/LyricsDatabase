If I loved you, time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come in an easy way
`Round in circles I'd go
Longin' to tell you but, afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you

Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you
