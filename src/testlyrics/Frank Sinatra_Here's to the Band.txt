Hear that music playing, listen to what it's saying
Throughout the years I've made a lot of friends
Many became famous, most of them go nameless
But I dedicate this song to all of them
I've sung with the best and I've had it all
I've gone from neighborhood saloons to Carnegie Hall
I've been down and out and I've been in demand
But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!
Those magical notes, those musical pearls
I've sung with all the Counts, the Dukes, the Kings, and the Earls
And the experience, I have to say, was grand
But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!        
Strings soaring, horns boring        
Drums pounding in my ear
To start at the ground and reach for the top
To have such a wonderful career, I just gotta stop
Stop and turn around to thank everyone that sits on the stand?
Cause I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!
Here's to those ladies and the gentlemen
Here's to the AF of MI wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!
Here's to the band!
