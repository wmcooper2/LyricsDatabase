Who's wonderful, who's marvelous?
Miss Annabelle Lee
(My Annabelle Lee)

Who's kissable, who's lovable?
Miss Annabelle Lee
Ain't she pretty, baby?

What would you give?
Escortin' her, supportin' her
Don't forget that she's exclusive

Who's dignified, who's glorified?
Miss Annabelle Lee
(Watch her passin' by)

What makes me fall?
She has it all, just look and you'll see
So you ain't telling me a thing, boy

I'm tellin' you
Who's wonderful, who's marvelous?
Miss Annabelle Lee

Knows everything, shows everything
Miss Annabelle Lee
This kid is warm, she's true to form
Just bet and you'll see
(Oh, you ain't tellin' me a thing, boy)

Boy, I'm tellin' you
Who's wonderful, who's marvelous?
Miss Annabelle Lee
(Miss Annabelle Lee)
