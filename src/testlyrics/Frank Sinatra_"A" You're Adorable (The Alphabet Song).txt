When Johnny Jones was serenading Mary
He sure could quote a lot of poetry
But he'd much rather tell 'er what he learned in his speller
When they both attended PS 33

(A) you're adorable
(B) you're so beautiful
(C) you're a cutie full of charms
(D) youre a darling and
(E) you're exciting
(F) you're a feather in my arms

(G) you look good to me
(H) you're so heavenly
(I) you're the one I idolize
(J) we're like Jack and Jill
(K) you're so kissable
(L) is the love light in your eyes

M, N, O, P (you could go on all day)
Q ,R, S, T (alphabetically speaking, you're OK)

(U) made my life complete
(V) means you're *awf'lly sweet*
W, X, Y, Z
Its fun to wander through
The alphabet with you
To tell (us what?) I mean (uh-huh?)
To tell you what you mean to me
(We love you alphabetically)
