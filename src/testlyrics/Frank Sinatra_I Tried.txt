I tried, 
Tried to impress you, 
My love, 
I gave it all
Each hour ever at your beck and call.
I tried, 
Tried to caress you,
My soul, 
Filled with desire, 
Two arms craving the one I admire.
Your charm was so appealing, 
I loved you from the start,
There's still that same old feeling, 
Concealed here in my heart.
I tried making you love me, 
And you couldn't decide,
But I'll never regret that I tried, 
And tried and tried.
