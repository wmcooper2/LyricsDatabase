In the Heaven stars are dancing
And the mountain moon is new
What a rare night for romancing
Mind if I make love to you?

Since the dear day of our meeting
I've wanted to tell you all I long to do
Dawn is nearing, time is fleeting
Mind if I make love to you?

If you let me, I'll endeavor
To persuade you I'm your party for two
And from then on, you will never mind
If I make love to you?
Mind if I make love to you?
