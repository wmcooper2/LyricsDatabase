It's a blue world without you, it's a blue world alone.
My days and nights that once were filled with heaven,
With you away, how empty they have grown.
It's a blue world from now on, it's a through world for me.
The sea, the sky, my heart and I, we're all an indigo hue,
Without you, it's a blue, blue world.
