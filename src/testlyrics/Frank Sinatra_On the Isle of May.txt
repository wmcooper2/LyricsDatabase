We strolled along through the heaven
And it was June, June on the Isle of May
Your lips were sweet as the heaven
Love was in bloom there on the Isle of May

Cause in your arms heaven opened its door
Then like a fool I sailed away
But our love will bring us together
When it is June, June on the Isle of May
