When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughin', oh when you're laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that sighin', be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you

But when you're cryin', your bring on the rain
So stop your sighin', be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby
The whole world smiles with you
