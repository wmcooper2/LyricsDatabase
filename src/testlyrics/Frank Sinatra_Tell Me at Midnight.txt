Tell me at midnight before the moon starts fading
Tell me at midnight, why go on masquerading.
The sky is so full of stars, and I can hear soft guitars,
The still of the night is clear, the thrill of my life is near,
Kiss me at midnight, let us love now or never,
Tell me at midnight, your heart is mine forever.
