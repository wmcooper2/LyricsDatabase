Here goes - baby here goes
Every worry, every fear goes
Every dull day in the year goes
I'm about to fall in love

Here goes - yes sir, here goes
Every sky that isn't clear goes
Every sigh that's insincere goes
'Cause it's you I'm dreamin' of

Looks like I've been sold out
Can't fight off the charms
I just couldn't hold out
It's cold out of your arms

Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above
Here goes - baby here goes

Someone ready for love
Here goes - brush that grin off
Brush that endless - bobby pin off
And the biscuits - that chagrin off

I'm about to fall in love
Here goes - get the fights out
And the quarrel - over nights out
And the patch up - when the lights out

That is all I'm dreaming of
Looks like I've been taken
Shaken off the tree
Looks like you'll be makin'

The bacon just for me
Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above

Here goes - here goes
Here goes someone - someone who's really in love
