(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)

Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is falling on the ground 
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground 
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, you be a real good little girl
Santa Claus is back in town
(Christmas, Christmas)

Got no sleigh with reindeer, no sack on my back
You're gonna see me coming in a big black Cadillac

Whoa oh it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is falling on the ground 
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town

(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)

Hang up your pretty stockings, turn off the light
Santa Claus is coming, down your chimney tonight

Whoa oh oh oh it's Christmas time pretty baby 
And the snow is falling on the ground 
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town
(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
