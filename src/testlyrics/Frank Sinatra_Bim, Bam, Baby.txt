Hey now!
Take a mip mack mop and a brim bram broom
And clim clam clean up the rim ram room
'Cause your bim bam baby`s comin' home tonight

Get my slim slam slippers and my easy chair
Run you flim flam fingers through my greasy hair
Then kiss me, baby, let me hold you tight

But even a honey bee needs some rest
When I get my jacket and my trousers pressed
I'll follow the swallow right back to my nest

Don't you wim wam worry if my train is late
Gonna shim sham shuttle on a frim fram freight
'Cause your bim bam baby's comin' home tonight
