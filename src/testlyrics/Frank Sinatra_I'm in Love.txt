[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]
[The way I feel about you]
I had you on my mind
Way we met it all happened so fast
It was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so let's make it last

[Sometimes you can't tell if love is real]
If love is real
[There ain't no doubt about the way I feel]
The way I feel, yeah
[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[The way I feel about you]
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
[I'm in love]
[I'm in love]

I woke up late last night
Visions of you real they seem
Needed you by my side
Now with you in my life I can live in this dream

[Sometimes you can't tell if love is real]
If love is real
[There ain't no doubt about the way I feel]
The way I feel
[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]

And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
[The way I feel about you]
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
[I'm in love] I'm in love, yeah...hey...yeah...
[I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love]
[Love, oh...]
[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]
[The way I feel about you]
[I'm in love]

I'm in love, love, love, yeah, yeah, yeah
[I've been thinkin' 'bout you] Baby
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
[The way I feel about you]
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
[I'm in love]

I'm in love, ah
[I'm in love]
I'm in love, ooh
[I've been thinkin' 'bout you] Ooh
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
[The way I feel about you]
Way I feel about you, there ain't no doubt about it
[I'm in love]
No, no, I'm in love
