I never cared much for moonlight skies, I never wink at fireflies,
But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light.
I never went for after-glow, candle light on the mistletoe,
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light.

Used to ramble through the park, shadow boxing in the dark,
Then you came and caused a spark, that's a four-alarm fire now.
I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows on my wine,
But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light.
