I can only give you love that lasts forever
And the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They will give you the world for a toy
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all
