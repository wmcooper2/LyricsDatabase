Never thought I'd fall, but when I hear you call,
I'm getting sentimental over you.
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.
I thought I was happy I could live without love,
Now I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of.
Won't you please be kind, and just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me
Cause I'm getting sentimental over you.
