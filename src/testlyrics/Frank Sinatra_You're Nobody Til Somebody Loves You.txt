You're a nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growin' old

The world still is the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
Find yourself somebody to love
