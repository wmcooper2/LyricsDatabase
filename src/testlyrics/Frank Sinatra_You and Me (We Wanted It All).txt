You and me, we wanted it all we wanted it all
Passion without pain, sunshine without rainy days
We wanted it always

You and me, we reached for the sky, the limit was high
Never giving in, certain we could win that prize
I should have seen it in your eyes

Look how all our dreams came true
See how I've got me and, baby, you've got you
Through it all, just one thing died
A little thing called love, something deep inside

You and me, we're not like the rest, we once were the best
Back when we were dumb, how did we become so smart
And learn to break each other's heart?

Look how all our dreams came true
See how I've got me, baby, you've got you
Through it all, just one thing died
A little thing called love, something deep inside

You and me, we're not like the rest, we once were the best
But look what we became, isn't it a cryin' shame
That we almost made it?

But we wanted it all
Baby, you and me
We wanted it all
