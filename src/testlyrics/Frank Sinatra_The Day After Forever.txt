All day tomorrow I'll be whispering your name
And the day after forever I know I'll do the same
May-time or winter I won't let you out of sight
And the day after forever we'll talk about tonight
Your laughter is a melody that I'll remember long
It plays upon my heartstrings, it's my fav'right song
All through a lifetime I'll be loving you and then
On the day after forever I'll just begin again
