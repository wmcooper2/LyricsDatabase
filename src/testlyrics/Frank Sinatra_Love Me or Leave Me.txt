G.Kahn/W.Donaldson
Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
You might find the night time the right time for kissing
but night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intended to be independently blue
I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and to give back tomorrow
My love is your love
There's no love for nobody else
