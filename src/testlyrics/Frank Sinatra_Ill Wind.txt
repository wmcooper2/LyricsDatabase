Blow ill wind
Blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good
No good
Go ill wind
Go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that ain't good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame
So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good

So, ill wind, blow away
Please let me rest today
You're blowing me no good, no good, no good
