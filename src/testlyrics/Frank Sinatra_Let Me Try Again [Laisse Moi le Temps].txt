I know I said that I was leaving,
But I just couldn't say good-bye.
It was only self-deceiving
To walk away from someone who
Means everything in life to you.
You learn from every lonely day
I've learned and I've come back to stay.

Let me try again; let me try again.
Think of all we had before,
Let me try once more.
We can have it all, you and I again.
Just forgive me or I'll die.
Please let me try again.

I was such a fool to doubt you,
To try to go it all alone.
There's no sense to life without you.
Now all I do is just exist
And think about the chance I've missed.
To beg is not an easy task,
But pride is such a foolish mask.

Let me try again; let me try again.
Think of all we had before,
Let me try once more.
We can have it all, you and I again.
Just forgive me or I'll die.
Please let me try again.
