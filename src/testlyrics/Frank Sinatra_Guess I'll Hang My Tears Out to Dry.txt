The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
And when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't put myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
Must get her get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

Then somebody says, just forget about her
So I gave her a treatment, a try
And strangely enough I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
