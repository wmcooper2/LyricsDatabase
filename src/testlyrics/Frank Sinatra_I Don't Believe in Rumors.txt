Somebody else told somebody else
And that somebody said we were through
But I don't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

Wherever I walk, the people all talk
And they're saying it's time that I knew
But I don't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

For everyone knows how a rumor grows
When the gossips are doing their worst
But somehow I feel if the stories were real
You would have come to me first

Whatever they say and say what they may
Still it isn't a thing you would do
So I won't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

For everyone knows how a rumor grows
When the gossips are doing their worst
But somehow I feel if the stories were real
You would have come to me first

So whatever they say and say what they may
Still it isn't a thing you would do
So I won't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you
