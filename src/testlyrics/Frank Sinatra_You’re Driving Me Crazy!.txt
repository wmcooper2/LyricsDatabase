You, you're driving me crazy! 
What did I do? 
What did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy, 
Clouding the skies of blue
How true, 
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me
Believe, me they knew, but you
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me
When I needed you
Yes you, you're driving me crazy! 
What did I do to you?
