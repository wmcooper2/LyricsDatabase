Come fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away

Come fly with me, will float down to Peru
In llama-land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come on fly with me, we'll float down in the blue

Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You might hear
All the angels cheer because we're together

Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say those words and we'll feed those birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away, we'll fly

Once I get you up there
Where the air is so rarefied
We'll gonna glide
Absolutely petrified
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so awfully near
You might even hear
A gang of angels cheer just because we're together

Weather-wise, it's such a groovy day
You just say that words and I'll beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they do say
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly
Pack up let's fly away
