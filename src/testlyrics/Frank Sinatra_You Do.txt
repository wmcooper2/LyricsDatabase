Who knows how much I love you,
You do

No one means more to me than,
You do,
You take December and smile it into May,
And then December comes back again
When you're away

Who has a charm that very few do,
Who makes life necessary

You do.
And who can take my dreams,
And make my dreams come true

Who don't give me three guesses,
One will do.
