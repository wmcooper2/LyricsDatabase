We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover

I have a feeling, it's a feeling I'm concealing - I don't know why
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you, so strong for you
Why go on stalling? I am falling; love is calling; why be shy?

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it; let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?

Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it; still we can try
To make a go of it

We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be; let our hearts discover

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love
