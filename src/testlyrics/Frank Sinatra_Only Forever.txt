Do I want to be with you as the years come and go?
Only forever if you care to know.
Would I grant all your wishes and be proud of the task,
Only forever if someone should ask.

How long would it take me to be near if you beckon,
Offhand I would figure, less than a second.
Do you think I'll remember how you looked when you smiled,
Only forever, that's putting it mild.
