When I take you out tonight with me, honey, here's the way it's gonna be,
You will sit behind a team of snow-white horses in the slickest gig you'll ever see.

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry when I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top.
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters when I drive them high steppin' strutters,
Nosy folks will peep through the shutters and their eyes will pop.

Those wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown, the dashboard's genuine leather.
With nice bright curtains that can roll right down in case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright side lights winking and blinkin, ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinking,
You can keep your rig if you're thinking that I care to swap
For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top.

(Would you say the fringe was made of silk?) Wouldn't have no other kind but silk.
(Has it really got a team of snow-white horses?)
One's like snow, the others more like milk (so you can tell `em apart)
All the world would fly in a flurry, when I take you out in the surrey,

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top.
When we hit that road hell for leather, cats and dogs all dance in the heather.
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop.
The wind will whistle as we rattle along, the cows will moo in the clover

The river will ripple out a whispered song, and whisper it over and over.
Don't you wish you'd go on forever, don't wish you'd go on forever,
Don't you wish you'd go on forever and would never stop
In that shiny little surrey with fringe on the top
