Well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go along
Till the lord will come and call, call me away, oh yeah
Well the morning's so bright
And the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
(alt lyric: 'and the night, night is as fair as the day, oh yes')

(There will be peace in the valley for me, some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
(There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, my Lord,
no trouble, trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down, down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

(There will be peace in the valley for me, some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
(There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, oh my Lordy, no trouble, trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me, [for me]
