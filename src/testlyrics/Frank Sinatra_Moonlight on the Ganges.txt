Moonlight on the ganges, my little hindu,
When I whisper love's sweet melody,
All our dreams and our schemes came true.
Someday on the ganges, I'll need you once more,
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore.
(musical interlude)
Moonlight on the ganges, my little hindu,
When I whispeedr love's sweet melody,
All our dreams and our schemes came true.
Someday on the ganges, I'll need you once more,
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss, kiss the silent shore.
