I wish I didn't love you so, my love for you should have faded long ago.
I wish I didn't need your kiss, why must your kiss torture me as long as this.
I might be smiling by now with some new tender friend,

Smiling by now with my heart on the mend,
But when I try, something in my heart says no.
You're still there, I wish I didn't love you so.
