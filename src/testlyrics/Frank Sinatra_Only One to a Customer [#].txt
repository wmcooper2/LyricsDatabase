Only one to a customer, only one,
One crack at paradise, next to none,
Here am I riding high on a miracle come full blown,
Hold him tight through a night like I've never known.
Because there's only one kind of wonderful,
I still try it, you and that smile I see in your eyes,
You'll never know the feeling until you spent your life in line,
Only one to your customer, and this time, I got mine.

[musical interlude]
Only one to a customer, rarely two,
But when you got that dream, one will do,
Why despair at the fair possibility luck has flown,
Stick around, fend your ground, till the cards are shown.
Because there's only one way they won't come up all aces high,
That's it, you've let the deal pass you by,
Somebody up there bottle the thrill, and like the rarest wine,
If it's one to a customer, I say, just fine,
Only one to a customer, and this one, this little bird is mine.
