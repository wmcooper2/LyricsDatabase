It seems to me I've heard that song before
It's from an old familiar score
I know it well, that melody
It's funny how a theme
Recalls a favorite dream
A dream that brought you so close to me
I know each word, because I've heard that song before
The lyrics said: "for evermore"
For evermore's a memory
Please have them play it again
And (Then) I'll remember just when
I heard that lovely song before
