This is just a little samba
built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow but the root is still that note
Now this new one is the consequence 
of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale I know and at the end I've come
To nothing, or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note 
as I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note 
all the love I feel for you
Any one who wants the whole show do-re-mi-fa-so-la-si-do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know
