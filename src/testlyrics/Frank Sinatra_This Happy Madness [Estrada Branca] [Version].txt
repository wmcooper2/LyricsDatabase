What should I call this happy madness 
that I feel inside of me
Some kind of wild October gladness 
that I never thought I'd see
What has become of all my sadness 
all my endless lonely sighs
Where are my sorrows now

What happened to the frown 
and is that self contented clown
Standing grinning in the mirror really me
I'd like to run through Central Park 
carve your initials in the bark
Of every tree I pass for every one to see

I feel that I've gone back to childhood 
and I'm skipping through the wild wood
So excited that I don't know what to do
What do I care if I'm a juvenile 
I smile my secret little smile
Because I know the change in me is you

What should I call this happy madness 
all this unexpected joy
That turned the world into a baby's bouncing toy
The god's are laughing far above 
one of them gave a little shove
And I fell gaily, gladly, madly into love
