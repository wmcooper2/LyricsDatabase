Shake down the stars, pull down the clouds,
Turn off the moon, do it soon,
I can't enjoy the night without you,
Shake down the stars.
Dry up the streams, stop all my dreams,
Cut off the breeze, do it please,
I never thought I'd cry about you,
Shake down the stars.
I gave you my arms, my lips, my heart,
My love, my life, my all,
But the best that I had to offer you
I found was all too small.
Crush every rose, hush every prayer,
Break every vow, do it now,
I know I cannot live without you,
Shake down the stars.
