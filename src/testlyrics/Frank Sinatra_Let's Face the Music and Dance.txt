There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and
romance
Let's face the music and dance
Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have that chance
Let's face the music and dance
Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune - and then...
There may be teardrops to shed
So (But) while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and
romance
(Let's face the music and dance, dance)
(Let's face the music - let's here that music)
Let's face the music and dance
