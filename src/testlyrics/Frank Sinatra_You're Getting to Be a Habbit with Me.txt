Every kiss, every hug
Seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me
Let me stay in your arms
I'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be a habit with me
I used to think your love was something that I could take or leave alone
But now I couldn't do without my supply
I need you for my own
Oh, I can't break away
I must have you every day
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches
And I can't get free
You're getting to be a habit with me
Can't break it
You're getting to be a habit with me

You've got me in your clutches
And I can't get free
Like getting shut-eye,
You are what I need
Eternally, ohhh! my
You're getting to be a habit with me
