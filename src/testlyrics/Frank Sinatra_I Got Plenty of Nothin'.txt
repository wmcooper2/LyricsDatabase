I got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got no car,
Got no mule,
Got no misery
Folks with plenty of plenty
They got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody?s gonna rob them while
they're out making more
What for?
I got no lock on the door
that's no way to be
They can steal the rug
From the floor
that's OK with me
Cause the things that I prize
Like the stars in the sky

Are all free
Say I've got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got my girl
Got my song,
Got heaven the whole daylong.
Got my girl
Got my lawn
Got my song
I've got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got my girl
Got my song,
Got heaven the whole daylong.
Got my girl
Got my lawn
Got my song
