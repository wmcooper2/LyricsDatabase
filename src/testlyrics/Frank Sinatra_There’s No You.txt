I feel the autumn breeze
It steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp
And in its song there is sadness because
There's no you
The lonely autumn trees
How softly they're sighing
For summer is dying they know
That in my heart there's no gladness because
There's no you
The park that we walked in
The garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall
In spring we'll meet again
We'll kiss and recapture 
The summertime rapture
We knew
And from that day never more will I say
There's no you
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall
In spring we'll meet again
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture
We knew
And from that day never more will I say
There's no you
