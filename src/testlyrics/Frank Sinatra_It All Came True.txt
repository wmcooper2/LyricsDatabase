They told me you'd leave me all alone and blue,
And it all came true, yep, it all came true.
They told me you'd grieve me, fall to someone new,
It all came true, it all came true.
They said that someday, you won't love him any more.
And you'll come running right back to my little old shack
And take up where you left before.
They told me you'd love me like you used to do.
It all came true, it all came true.
They told me you'd leave me so all alone and blue,
And it all came true, oh, it's so true.
They told me you'd grieve me, fall for somebody new,
It all came true, so T-are-U.
They said that someday, you won't love him any more.
And you'll come running right back to my little old shack
And take up where you left before.
They told me you'd love me like you used to do.
It all came true, it all came true.
They told me you'd love me like you used to do.
And it all came true.
