Ol MacDonald had a farm, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.
And on this farm there was a chick, the purdiest chick I know.
With a little curve here and a little curve there
This chick she had curves everywhere,
Ol MacDonald had a farm, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.

And, oh, this chick she had a walk, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.
And how this walk would drive em wild, swingin to and fro.
With a little wiggle here and a little wiggle there,
Man this chicks had wiggles to spare.
Ol Macdonald had a farm, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.

When she went walkin in the town, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo,
The local gentry popped their eyes, tarnation, what a show.
With a gol dang here and a gosh darn there,
Heavens to Betsy, I do declare!
Ol Macdonald had a farm, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.

There was a barn dance Saturday night, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.
And the fellas came from miles around just to see her do-see-do.
With a promenade here and a promenade there, At a square dance boy,
This chick was no square. Ol Macdonald had a farm, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.

I used to be a travelin man, eeeee-yi-ooo.
Until I hit MacDonald's place things were mighty slow.
With a little chick here and a little chick there,
I didn't have a real chick anywhere.
Ol Macdonald had a farm, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.

This farmers daughter knocked me out, ee-yi-ee-yi-ooo.
I asked Macdonald for her hand and Pappy hollered: go.
With a little curve here and a little curve there,
A goll dang here and a gosh darn there,
A do-see-do here and a promenade there,
Got my own private county fair.
That Ol Macdonald had a farm, ee-yi-oo ii-ooooooo.
