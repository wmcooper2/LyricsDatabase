You don't laugh anymore, when we're alone
 You don't talk quite as long, when we're on the phone
 You say that you, still love me so, but I can read between the lines
 You don't hear half the things, that I say to you
 You don't hold me as close, as you used to do
 You say that you, won't let me go, but I can read between the lines
 Your love for me is over, it isn't hard to tell
 In every single thing you do, you say it all too well
 And the glow in your eyes, is there no more
 When you speak of the plans, that you have in store
 It's time my dear, that I let you know that I can read between the lines
