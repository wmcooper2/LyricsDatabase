Uh, this is a song that came by way of request
I haven't done this song since I was fifteen years old
Oh, that's a long time ago
Shoot

Strangers in the night 
Exchanging glances
Wondering in the night 
What were the chances?
We'd be sharing love 
Before the night was through
Something in your eyes 
Was so exciting
Something in your smile 
Was so inviting
Something in my heart 
Told me I must 
I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello 
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away 
A warm embracing dance away and 

Ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight 
In love forever
It turned out so right 
For strangers in the night

Two strangers in the night
