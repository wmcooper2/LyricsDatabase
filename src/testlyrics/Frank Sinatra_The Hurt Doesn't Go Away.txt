The hurt doesn't go away, the tears never cease to fall
You cover them over with people and places
Hoping you'll want to break away
Oh my darling, the pain doesn't go away
When love doesn't want to stay
And inside your laughter, the world's laughing too
Saying you'll never make one more day
All the nonsense of it and oh, the pain doesn't go away
The tears never cease to fall, the hurt doesn't go away
The pain doesn't go away
