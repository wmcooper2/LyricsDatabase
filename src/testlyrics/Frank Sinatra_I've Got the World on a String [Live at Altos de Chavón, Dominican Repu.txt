I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, cant you see, I'm in love

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so
If I should ever let you go, oh yeah

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
What a world, what life, I'm in love
Oh yeah, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh yeah, I'm in love
(He's in love, he's in love)
