Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me,
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free.
So I asked a friendly star the way that lovers often do
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you.
Now I shout it from the highest hill, even told the golden daffodils,
And now my heart's an open door, and my secret love's no secret any more.
