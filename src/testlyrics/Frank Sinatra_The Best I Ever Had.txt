I've tried to break the habit
But somehow I just keep waking up alone
There's something deep inside me
That refuses to believe you're really gone
And every night I fall asleep
By your side of this great big double bed
Remembering that the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
I know I should be sleeping
Like a kitten in somebody else's arms
But I lie awake remembering all the ways
We used to keep each other warm
I know that nothing's perfect but we came so close
How could it turned out bad?
But even so the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
How I missed your tender kisses
And the gentle arms that used to hold me tight
Oh they say that all good things must end
But endings always leave somebody sad
But I remember that the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
I can't forget the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
