Waitin' for the train to come in
Waitin' for my man to come home
I've counted every minute of each livelong day
Been so melancholy since he went away

I've shed a million teardrops or more
Waitin' for the one I adore
I'm waitin' in the depot by the railroad track
Lookin' for the choo-choo train that brings him back

I'm waitin' for my life to begin
Waitin' for the train to come in

I'm waitin' in the depot by the railroad track
Lookin' for the choo-choo train that brings him back
I'm waitin' for my life to begin
Waitin' for the train to come in

Waiting 
Waiting 
I'm waitin' for the train to come in.
