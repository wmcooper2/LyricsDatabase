And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jilly loves you more than you will know,
Wo wo wo
Oh bless you please, Mrs. Robinson,
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are
Sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you
Feel at home

The PTA, Mrs. Robinson, 
Wot OK the way you do your thing,
Ding ding ding
And you'll get yours, Mrs. Robinson,
Foolin' with that young stuff like you do
Boo hoo hoo, woo woo woo

So how's your bird, Mrs. Robinson?
"Dandy", Mrs. Robinson you'd say
Hey hey hey
Well have you heard, Mrs. Robinson,
Mine is fine as wine, and I should know
Ho ho ho

Oh bless you please, Mrs. Robinson,
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,
Hey hey hey

Mrs. Robinson

Keep them cards and letters comin' in, Robin, baby!
