(chorus) [Frank with chorus]
Goodnight, my love, sleep tight, my love,
It's almost dawn, remember me in your dreams.
Just one more kiss, and after this, I must be gone,
Remember me in your dreams.
The hours seemed like minutes, while I held you near.
The minutes will be hours, till we meet again, so dear,
Before we part, please take my heart,
And don't forget to remember me in your dreams.
 (Remember me in your dreams.)
 (Remember me in your dreams.)
[The hours seem like minutes, while I held you near.]
[The minutes will be hours, till we meet again,] so dear,
Before we part, please take my heart,
And don't forget to remember me in your dreams.
