I'm blue every Monday
Thinkin' over Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
It seems that I sigh all day Tuesday
I cry all day Wednesday
Oh my, how I long for you

And then comes Thursday
Gee, it's long, it never gets by
And Friday makes me feel
Just like I'm gonna die

But after pay day, is my fun day
I shine all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you

And then comes Thursday
Gee, it's long, it never goes by
And Friday makes me feel
Like I'm gonna die

But after pay day, is my fun day
I shine all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you

That one day
It's a fun day
Sunday is my day with you
