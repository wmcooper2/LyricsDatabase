A thorough knowledge I've got about girls
I've been around
And after learning a lot about girls
This is the important fact I found

I've no proof when people say
I'm more or less aloof
But you're sensational
I don't care if you are called,

"The Fair Miss Frigidaire"
'Cause you're sensational
Making love is quite an art
What you require

Is the proper squire
To fire your heart
And if you say
That one fine day

You'll let me come to call
We'll have a ball
'Cause you're sensational, sensational
That's all, that's all, that's all
