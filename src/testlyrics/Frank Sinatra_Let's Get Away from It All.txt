I'm so tired of this dull routine
Up to town on the eight fifteen
Back at night, off to bed and then
Get up and start it all over again

Let's take a boat to Bermuda
Let's take a plane to Saint Paul
Let's take a kayak to Quincy or Nyack
Let's get away from it all

Let's take a trip in a trailer
No need to come back at all
Let's take a powder to Boston for chowder
Let's get away from it all

We'll travel 'round from town to town
We'll visit ev'ry state
And I'll repeat, I love you sweet
In all the forty eight

Let's go again to Niag'ra
This time we'll look at the fall
Let's leave our hut, dear
Get out of our rut, dear
Let's get away from it all
Hit the road
And really get away from it all

Let's motor down to Miami
Let's climb the Grand Canyon Wall
Let's catch a tuna
Way out in Laguna
Let's get away from it all

Let's travel South of the border
I'll get a real Spanish shawl
For me a muchacha
But not if I watcha
Let's get away from it all

They say there's no place
Quite like home
It's a charming thought and pure
But until the world we roam
How can we be sure

Let's spend a weekend in Dixie
I'll get a real southern drawl
Then off to Reno
But just to play keno
Let's get away from it all

We'll travel around from town to town
Visit every state
I'll repeat that I love you sweet
In all the forty eight

Off to Niag'ra
Next time we're digging the falls
Yes, we're leaving
We're hitting the road
Oh we're leaving
We're hitting the road
Yes, we're leaving
We're hitting the road
Oh, we're getting away from it all
