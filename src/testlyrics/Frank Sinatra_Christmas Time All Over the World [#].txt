It's Christmas time all over the World
And Christmas here at home
The church bells chime wherever we roam
(Sa riktig God Jul
Feliz Natal
Shenoraavor Nor Dari)
To you

The snow is thick in most of the world
And childrens' eyes are wide
As old Saint Nick gets ready to ride
(So Feliz Navidad
Sretan Bozic
And Happy New Year)
To you

Though the customs may change
And the language is strange
This appeal we feel is real
In Holland or Hong Kong

It's Christmas time all over the World
In places near and far
And so my friend wherever you are
(Ein frohliches Weihnachten
Kala Christougenna
Yoi kurisumasu)
Which means a very Merry Christmas
To you
