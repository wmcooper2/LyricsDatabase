She was Boston, I was Vegas,
She was crepe suzette, I was pie,
She was lectures, I was movies, but I loved her.
She was Mozart, I was Macy,
She was afternoon tea, I was saloon,
She was Junior League, I was Dodgers,
But I loved her morning, night and noon.
Opposites attract, the wise men claim,
Still I wish that we had been a little more the same.
It might have been a shoot out war,
If we had know each other more.
She was polo, I was race track,
She was museum, I was G.P.
She did her best to change me
Though she never never knew quite how,
But I loved her, almost as much as I do now.

She was Wall Street, I was pawn shop,
She was French champagne, I was beer,
She knew much more that I did
But there was one thing she didn't know,
That I loved her, 'cause I never never told her so.
