You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
