And I got the song of the robin
And I got a roof in the sky
Wonder why my heart keeps a throbbing, a throbbing
A son of God's country am I

And I got the flames and the mountains
And that treasure's mine if I try
One by one my blessings I'm counting and counting
A son of God's country am I

I got the sun up in the sky, the streams when I'm dry
The fruit on the boughs of the trees
The clouds bringing me rain, the fields giving me grain
Thanks to the Maker for these

And I got a loved one who loves me
Kids to make my cares hurry by
I may not be in heaven but I can't be far away
A son of God's country am I

(And I got a loved one who loves me)
My baby loves me
(Kids to make my cares hurry by)
Hurry by, hurry by, hurry by
I may not be in heaven but I can't be far away
A son of God's country am I
A son of God's country am I
