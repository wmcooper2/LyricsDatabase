I want some red roses for a blue lady,
Mister florist, take my order, please.
We had a silly quarrel the other day,
I hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away.

Wrap up those red roses for a blue lady,
Send them to the sweetest gal in town.
And if they do the trick, I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchids for her wedding gown.
