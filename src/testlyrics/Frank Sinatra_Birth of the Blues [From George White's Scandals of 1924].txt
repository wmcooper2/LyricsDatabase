These are the blues
Nothing but blues

Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can

They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
This is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill way up on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Until it was worn into a blue note

And then they nursed it
They rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues

They nursed it
Then they rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues
