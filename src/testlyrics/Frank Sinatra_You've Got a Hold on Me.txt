You've got a hold on me
You've got that magic hold on me
When I'm alone now, I wonder
What is this power I'm under?

You cast a spell on me
That moment heaven fell on me
You've got a hold on me
What can I do
But always hold on to you

You cast a spell on me
That moment heaven fell on me
You've got a hold on me
What can I do
But always hold on to you
