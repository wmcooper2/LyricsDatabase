By the beautiful sea, you'll see a girl and a fella,
By the beautiful sea, you'll see a yellow umbrella,
That's where we'll spoon on the sand, and then pretty soon, hand in hand,
We walk through the waves, right up to our chins,
We dream happy flounders of flapping their fins,
When you're in love, the seaweed smells just like roses,
Each breaker we strike is like a velvet settee,
By evening the moon will be high,
And stardust will hit me kerplunk in the eye,
It's peachy when her and me can be by the beautiful, beautiful sea.
