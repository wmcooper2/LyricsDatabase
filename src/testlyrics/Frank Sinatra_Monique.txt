When they see Monique, I know they'll understand
Monique, Monique
I've hungered so for this
Monique, Monique
The magic of your kiss
Monique, Monique
Was Paris always there
Monique, Monique
I didn't know or care
But why am I dancing, my friends may well demand
I'll tell them Monique, Monique held my hand
When they see Monique, I'm sure they'll understand
