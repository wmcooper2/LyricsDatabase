When you're smiling 
When you're smiling 
The whole world smiles with you 
When you're laughing 
When you're laughing 
The sun comes shining through 
But when you're crying 
You bring on the rain 
So stop your sighing be happy again 
Keep on smiling 
'Cause when you're smiling 
The whole world smiles with you
