'Twas not so long ago we sailed to meet the foe
And thought our fighting days were done
We thought 'twas over then but now we're in again
To win the war that wasn't won

This time, we will all make certain
That this time is the last time

This time, we will not say "Curtain"
Till we ring it down in their own home town

For this time, we are out to finish
The job we started then

Clean it up for all time this time
So we won't have to do it again

Dressed up to win
We're dressed up to win
Dressed up for victory
We are just beginning
And we won't stop winning
Till the world is free

We'll fight to the finish this time
And we'll never have to do it again
