Dearest darling I'm writing you today
I'm writing you to say how much I love you, love you
How I miss you since you went away,
Each night in ev'ry dream I'm dreaming of you
Ev'ry minute brings you nearer,
Soon I'll hold you close to me
Sweetheart when we get together
Oh, what a day that will be
Dearest darling I'm closing with a kiss
And please remember this:
I'll always love you.
