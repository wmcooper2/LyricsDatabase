She's a sunflower, she's my one flower,
She's the flower of my heart.
I was born in Kansas, Iowa, bred in Kansas,
And when I get married, I'll be wed in Kansas
There's a true-blue gal who promised she would wait,
She's a sunflower from the Sunflower State.
She's a sunflower, she's my sunflower,
And I'll know we'll never part,
She's a sunflower, she's my one flower,
She's the flower of my heart.

Troubles end in Kansas, folks unbend in Kansas,
Everyone you'll meet will be your friend in Kansas,
And they'll all be there to help me celebrate
With my sunflower from the Sunflower State.
She's a sunflower, she's my sunflower,
And I'll know we'll never part,
She's a sunflower, she's my one flower,
She's the flower of my heart.
Oh the moon is brighter and stars are bluer,
And the gals are sweeter and their hearts are truer,
And I'm here to take, there's one who's really great,
She's that sunflower from the Sunflower State.
She's a sunflower, she's my sunflower,
And I'm sure we'll never part,
She's a sunflower, she's my one flower,
She's the flower of my heart.
