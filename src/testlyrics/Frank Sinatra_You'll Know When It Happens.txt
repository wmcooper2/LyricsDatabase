You'll know when it happens, you won't have to guess
All at once you'll find your heart is filled with happiness
You'll know when it happens, love can't be disguised
All at once the dreams you dreamed will all be realized
Your eyes will see things that are not really there
Your lips will say things, things you never would dare
You'll know when it happens, suddenly you'll say
"Darling, I'm in love with you," it happens just that way

Your eyes will see things that are not really there
Your lips will say things, things you never would dare
You'll know when it happens, suddenly you'll say
"Darling, I'm in love with you," it happens just that way
