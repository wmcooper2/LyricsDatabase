I came down from Butte, Montana, for a little change of scene,
And I stopped to stay in Santa Fe, where I met a pretty queen.
Hair of gold, eyes of blue, lips like cherry wine
She's the prettiest gal I ever know and I'm gonna make her mine.

Now I planned to leave on Monday, but she held me kinda tight,
So I stood my ground and hung around, and then I left on Friday night.
Oh, hair of gold, eyes of blue, lips like cherry wine,
The prettiest gal I ever knew and I'm gonna make her mine.
