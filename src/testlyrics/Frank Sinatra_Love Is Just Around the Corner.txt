Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when i'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and i couldn't be a loner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're outer than venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and i'm around you.
