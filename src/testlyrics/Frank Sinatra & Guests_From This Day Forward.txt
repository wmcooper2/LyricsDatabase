From this day forward, I promise you with all my heart,
That we shall never be apart, from this day on.
From this day forward, I'm yours to call your very own,
I live my life for you alone, from this day on.
On and on, I'll welcome each new tomorrow,
Knowing that our tomorrow is here.
On and on, and even beyond forever,
Heaven is mine whenever you're near.
From this day forward, I give you me with all my love,
From this day forward, from this day on.
From this day forward, I give you me with all my love,
From this day forward, from this day on.
