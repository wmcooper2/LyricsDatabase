I don't why I should
Cry over you
Sigh?
Over you.
Even be blue

I should have known that you'd leave me alone
And break my heart in two
Although you have left me alone to pine
And all my love was a big fat waste of time
Someday your heart will be broken like mine
So why should I cry over you

I should have known that you'd leave me alone
And break my heart in two
Although you have left me alone to pine
And all my love was a big fat waste of time
Someday your heart will be broken like mine
So why should I cry over you

You broke my heart, you took it apart
So pack up your bags and beat it
Why should I cry over you?
