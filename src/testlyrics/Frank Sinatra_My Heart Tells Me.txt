My heart tells me this is just a fling
And yet you say our love means everything
Do you mean what you are saying?
Or is this a little game you're playing?

My heart tells me I will cry again
Lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through
Will I be sorry if I do?
Should I believe my heart or you?

My heart tells me I will cry again
'Cause lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through
Will I be sorry if I do?
Should I believe my heart or you?
