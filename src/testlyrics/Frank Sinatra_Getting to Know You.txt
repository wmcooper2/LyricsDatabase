Getting to know you, getting to know all about you,
Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me,
Getting to know you, putting it my way, but nicely,
You are my cup of tea.
Getting to know you, getting to feel free and easy,
When I am with you, getting to know what to say.
Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy,
Because of all the beautiful things and new things
I'm learning about you day by day.
