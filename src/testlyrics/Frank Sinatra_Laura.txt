Laura is the face in the misty lights
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The (love) that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

And you see laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was laura but she's only a dream

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was laura
But she's only a dream
