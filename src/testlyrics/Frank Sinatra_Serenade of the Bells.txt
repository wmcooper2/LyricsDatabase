In the sleepy town of San Juanita, there's a story that the padre tells;
Of a gay senor and senorita, and the serenade of the bells.
Seems they asked the padre for permission to be married, early in the spring,
But their folks had just made one condition - that the mission bells had to ring.
Everyone knew that the bells were broken and hadn't sounded for a long long time.
Then one night the village was astounded, for the bells began to chime.
Still the bells are broken, goes the story, but if in your heart a true love dwells,
They will chime for you in all its glory; that's the serenade of the bells.
