Please don't talk about me when I'm gone,
Oh, honey though our friendship ceases, from now on;
And, listen, if you can't say anything real nice,
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice.

We're parting, you go your way I'll go mine,
It's best that we do;
Here's a kiss! I hope that this brings lots of luck to you.

Makes no difference how I carry on,
Remember, please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
