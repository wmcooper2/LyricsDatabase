After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You'll feel blue you're gonna be sad
You've missed the dearest pal that (slickest partner) you ever had

There'll come a time don't you forget it
(Yeah) there'll come a time when you're gonna regret it
Some day when you get lonely
Your heart will break like mine (and) you'll want me only

After you've gone (split) after you've gone away (flown the coop)
After we paid our dues together
You should have stayed through all that nasty weather
Someday while you're feeling badly
You'll need the only one that loves you so madly

But I'll be gone yes I'll be gone to stay
Yeah after I've gone after I've gone away
