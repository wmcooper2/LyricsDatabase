Most people live on a lonely island,
Lost in the middle of a foggy sea.
Most people long for another island,
One where they know they would like to be.
Bali Ha'i
May call you,
Any night,
Any day.
In your heart
You'll hear it call you:
"Come away,
Come away."
Bali Ha'i
Will whisper
On the wind
Of the sea:
"Here am I,
Your special island!
Come to me,
Come to me."
Your own special hopes,
Your own special dreams,
Bloom on the hillside
And shine in the streams.
If you try,
You'll find me
Where the sky
Meets the sea;
"Here am I,
Your special island!
Come to me,
Come to me!"
Bali Ha'i,
Bali Ha'i,
Bali Ha'i.
"Someday you'll see me,
Floating in the sunshine,
My head sticking out
>From a low-flying cloud;
You'll hear me call you,
Singing through the sunshine,
Sweet and clear as can be,
Come to me,
Here am I,
Come to me!"
Bali Ha'i,
Will whisper
On the wind
Of the sea:
"Here am I,
Your special island!
Come to me,
Come to me."
"Bali Ha'i,
Bali Ha'i,
Bali Ha'i."
