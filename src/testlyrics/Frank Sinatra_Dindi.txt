Sky, so vast is the sky
With far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go? 
Oh, I don't know, don't know
Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and to me

Oh, Dindi
If I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see 
When you're with me, oh my Dindi
Oh, Dindi
Like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing dindi
Happy Dindi 
When you are with me

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do
I'd let you go away
If you take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi
I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my Dindi

Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my Dindi, Dindi, Dindi, Dindi
