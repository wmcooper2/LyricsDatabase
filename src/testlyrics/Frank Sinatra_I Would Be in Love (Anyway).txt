If I lived the past over, saw today from yesterday
I would be in love anyway
If I knew that you'd leave me, if I knew you wouldn't stay
I would be in love anyway

Sometimes I think, think about before
Sometime I think, if I knew then what I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow

Though you'll never be with me, and there are no words to say
I'll still be in love anyway

If I knew then what I know now, 
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow 
If I knew then what I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow
