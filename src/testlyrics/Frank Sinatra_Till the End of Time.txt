Till the end of time `long as stars are in the blue
`Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing, I'll go on loving you.
Till the end of time. `long as roses bloom in May,
My love for you will go deeper with every passing day.
Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappear,
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears.
So take my hand in sweet surrender, and tenderly say that I'm
The one you'll love and live for, till the end of time.
