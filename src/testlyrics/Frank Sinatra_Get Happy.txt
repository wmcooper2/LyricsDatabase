Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on, get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

The sun is shining, come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy
We're going to the promised land

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash your sins 'way in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on, get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

That sun is shining, come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take you by the hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy
We're going to the promised land

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash your sins 'way in the tide
And it's all so nice and peaceful
When you get on the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

Forget your troubles, come on, get happy
Forget your troubles, come on, be happy
Forget your troubles, come on, stay happy
Happy, stay happy
