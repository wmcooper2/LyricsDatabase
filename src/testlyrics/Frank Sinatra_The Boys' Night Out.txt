Hey there, mister, build a fence around your sister
It's the, boys' night out
Hey there, buster, it's the Injuns after Custer
It's the, boys' night out
They're out to do the town and before they're through
It's bound to be likened to

The night they lost the Titanic and the Wall Street panic
What they're seekin' is a little cheek-to-cheekin'
It's the, boys' night out

And that moon's about as big as a honeydew
Well, it's the boys' night out and they're so romantic
But I'll give you a clue
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after, too
Boys' night out

It's the boys' night out and they're so romantic
But I'll give you a clue
What the boys are out after
(The boys are out after)
The girls are out after
(The girls are out after)

What the boys are out after, the girls are out after, too
