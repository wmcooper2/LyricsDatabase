It's quarter to three
There's no-one in the place
'Cept You and me.
So set 'em up Joe,
I've got a little story
I think you should know

We're drinking my friend,
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby, and one more
For the road

I've got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad
I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby, and one more
For the road

You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
So when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me
'Til it's talked away
Well, that's how it goes

And Joe I know you're getting anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
But this touch that I've found
Must be drowned or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
The long
It's so long
The long 
Very long
