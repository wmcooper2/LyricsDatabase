I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh or two
A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go, darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three, four

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a (no) bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together
Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who wants people?
When the steeple bell says
"Good night, sleep well"
We'll thank the small hotel together

Pretty window curtains made of chance
In a make-believe land
On the wall are several cheerful prints
Of Grant and Grover Cleveland
Look out into the parlor and feast your eyes
On the moose head on the wall
Perhaps you'd like to play the organ
They tune it every other fall
When the steeple bell says
"Good night, sleep well"
We'll thank the small hotel 
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together
