Somewhere in your heart
Try to find a place for me 
Somewhere in your heart
I won't care where it might be 

One little corner may not mean so much to you 
But one little corner would be enough to see me through

Somewhere in your dreams 
Let my lips come close to you
Though they're only dreams 
Someday they may all come true
No much to ask for such a tiny part
Won't you find a place for me
Somewhere in your heart
