Days without you when there's so much to tell,
What to do, I've got a restless spell.
How about you, are you alone as well?
What to do, I've got a restless spell.

Why should this love of mine find me
Restless and moody and blue
Shadows all seem to remind me
You're meant for me, dear, and I'm meant for you.

Love is swell, but you can't love alone,
Might as well be a statue of stone.
I'm lost without you dear, but what to do,
'Cause I've got a restless spell.
