Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came, my time was runnin' low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go
Now you're here and now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day

Now you are here and now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear, 'cause I've found my way
'Cause love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely
Lonely life that lovely
You found my lonely life that lovely day
