I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity
What to do?
What to do?
What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day
In London town
It had me low
And it had me down

I viewed the morning
With much alarm
The British Museum
Had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadn't past

For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining, shining, shining, shining, shining everywhere

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadn't past

For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere
