I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart

Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same, never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same, never be the same again
