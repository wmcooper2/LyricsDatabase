It's very nice to go trav'ling
To Paris, London and Rome
It's oh so nice to go trav'ling
But it's so much nicer, yes it's so much nicer, to come home

It's very nice to just wander
The camel route to Iraq
It's oh so nice to just wander
But it's so much nicer, yes it's oh so nice, to wander back

The mam'selles and frauleins, and the senoritas are sweet
But they can't compete 'cause they just don't have
What the models have, on Madison Ave

It's very nice to be footloose
With just a toothbrush and comb
It's oh so nice to be footloose
But your heart starts singin' when your homeward wingin' across the foam

And you know your fate is
Where the Empire State is
All you contemplate is
The view from Miss Liberty's dome

It's very nice to go trav'ling
But it's oh so nice to come home

You will find the maedchen and the gay muchachas are rare
But they can't compare with that sexy line
That parades each day at Sunset and Vine

It's quite the life to play gypsy
And roam as Gipsies will roam
It's quite the life to play gypsy
But your heart starts singin' when your homeward wingin' across the foam

And the Hudson River
Makes you start to quiver
Like the latest flivver
That's simply dripin' with crome

It's very nice to go trav'ling
But it's oh so nice to come home
No more customs
Burn the passport
No more packing
And unpacking
Light the home fire
Get my slippers
Make a pizza
