I touch your hand
And my arms grow strong
Like a pair of birds
That burst with song
My eyes look down
At your lovely face
And I hold the world
In my embrace
Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me
Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Angel and lover, heaven and earth
Are you to me
And when your youth and joy invade my arms
And fill my heart, as now they do
Then younger than springtime am I
Gayer than laughter am I
Angel and lover, heaven and earth
Am I with you
