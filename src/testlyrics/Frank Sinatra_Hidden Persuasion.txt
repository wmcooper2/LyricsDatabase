There's hidden persuasion within your eyes
Your charming indifference is but a disguise
I would be glad to love you if love is in the deal
But I must feel quite certain that the love is so real
Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires the element of chance
Here's hoping at least we'll find romance
