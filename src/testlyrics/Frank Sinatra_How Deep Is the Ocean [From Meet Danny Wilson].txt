How much do I love you? 
I'll tell you no lie 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? 
How many times in a day 
Do I think of you? 
How many roses are 
Sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel 
Just to be where you are? 
How far is the journey 
From here to a star? 
And if I ever lost you 
How much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky?
