There were tears in the crowded congregation,
There were hearts that have loved but all in vain,
T'was goodbye to the sweetheart of the nation,
At the wedding of Lili Marlene.
Men who'd marched where the desert sands were burning,
From Tobruc down the road to Alamein.
In their hearts were tender memories were returning,
At the wedding of Lili Marlene.
As she knelt where the candle lights were gleaming,
It seemed the choir sang soft and low,
Farewell, my angel of the lamplight,
We'll always love you so.
Down the aisle came the bride in all her glory,
To the strains of her own sweet love refrain,
T'was the end of a very lovely story,
At the wedding of Lili Marlene.
