Did i see moonlight and magnolia trees?
Smile again, my darling, if you please
Did i hear music on a warm spring breeze?
Speak again, my darling, if you please

Did i feel cool September rain just then?
If you please, touch my cheek with your hand again

When you are near me i can dream with ease
And I'm yours, my darling, if you please
