I hadn't anyone
Till you
I was a lonely one
Till you
I used to lie awake and wonder
If there could be
A someone in this wide world
Just made for me
And now I see
I had to save my love
For you
I never gave my love
Till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone
Till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone 
Till you
