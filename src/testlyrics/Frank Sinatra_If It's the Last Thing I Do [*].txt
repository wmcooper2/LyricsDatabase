If it's the last thing I do, I'll make you mine
Darling the first thing is you, in my design
Just like the stars guard the moon above me
That's just how I'll guard our love, so love me

Please love me
If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
I'll build a dream just for two

And then I'll make it come true
If it's the very last thing I do
Just like the stars guard the moon above me
That's just how I'll guard our love, so love me

Please love me
If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
I'll build a dream just for two

And then I'll make it come true
If it's the very last thing I do
