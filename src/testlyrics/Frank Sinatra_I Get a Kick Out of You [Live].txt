I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol, it doesn't move me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some like the bop-type refrain
I'm sure that if I heard even one riff
T'would bore me terrifically too
Yeah, I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yeah, I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously do don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yeah, I get a kick, yes, I get a kick yes, I get a kick out of you
