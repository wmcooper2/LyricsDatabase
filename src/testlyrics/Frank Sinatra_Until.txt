Until there are no stars to shine,
There's no such thing as time,
I'll love but you.
Until there are no songs to sing,

There's no such thing as sin,
I'll love but you
You were sent from heaven just for me.
And you are oh so heavenly,

Until there is no moon above,
There's no such thing as love,
I'll love but you.
