The light-hearted gay kind of charm you display, that's for me.
The wonderful sly little trick with your eye, that's for me.
What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish;
Do you like the movies, or what is your favorite dish?

The tilt of your chin, when you chuckle or grin, that's for me.
You might as well know that wherever you go, there I'll be
Just to make sure you keep your heart alone and fancy free.
No one else can have it; that's for me
