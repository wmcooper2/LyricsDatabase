When all the songs are out of tune,
And all the rhymes ring so untrue;
When I don't find the words to say -
The thoughts I long to bring to you;
When I hear lonely singers
Who are just as lost as me -
Making noise, not melody:

You will be my music.
You will be song.
You will be my music.
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong.

I'll never find the song to tell me
All the things I need to say.
And I'm afraid as time goes by
That someday soon you'll go away.
And I'll be lost in trying
For songs I'll never sing.
Wanting you is everything:

You will be my music.
You will be song.
You will be my music.
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong.
I can't wait any longer for my song.
