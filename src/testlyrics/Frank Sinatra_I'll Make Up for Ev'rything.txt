I'll make up for everything the world has done to you,
I'll make every little dream you ever dreamed come true.
I will help you to forget you ever shed a tear,
Should dark clouds become a threat, then you'll find me near.
We'll share all the rainy days that fate may have in store,

Laugh a lot and darling, what is more -
We will find the peace of mind that happiness can bring,
'Cause I'll make up for everything.
And we will find the peace of mind that happiness can bring,
'Cause I'll make up for everything.
