S'posin' I should fall in love with you
Do you think that you could love me too?
S'posin' I should hold you and caress you
Would it impress you or, perhaps, distress you?
S'posin' I should say "For you I yearn"
Would ya think I'm speaking out of turn?
And s'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you

S'posin' I should say "For you I yearn"
Would ya think that I'm speakin' out of turn?
And s'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin' 'cause I'm in love with you
