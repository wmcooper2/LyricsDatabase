Sometimes I feel discouraged and speak my words in vain.
But then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again.
Jesus is a rock in the

I know I've been converted, and Lord I ain't in a chain,
'Cause is my Captain, and the angels done tie my hand.

I want to go to heaven, Lord, I want to go right.
I know I gotta keep praying, gotta pray both day and night.
