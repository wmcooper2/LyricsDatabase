Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses
Morning me, evening me
And as the world slips

Far away, star away
Forever me with love
Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire

Pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence
Quietly, whisper me
Forever me with love
Forever me with love

And every day I'll
Gentle you, tender you
And oh, the way I'll
Velvet you, clover you

I'll wrap you up and
Ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you with shine!
Suddenly, magically

We found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you
Happy me, summer me
Winter me, always be mine!
