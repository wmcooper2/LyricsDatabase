Why is my heart dancing? Imagine dancing!
You look at me, and suddenly it's spring.
Why do I keep sighing? not sad, just sighing,
I'm young and free, and suddenly it's spring.

High on a hilltop, love is calling,
Someone should wish me happy falling.
No more being lonely, can I be lonely?
You look at me and suddenly it's spring.

High on a hilltop, love is calling,

No more being lonely, can I be lonely?
You look at me, I look at you
We're young and free, and suddenly it's spring.
