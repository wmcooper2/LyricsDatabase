Tell her you love her each day,
You'll make her happy that way
A simple "I love you" means more than money,
And with a kiss or two her life is sunny

Give her a reason to live,
She needs the love that you give,
Always remember that is what she lives for

She hopes you love her
Tell her you love her!
Tell her you love her
Today!

Give her a reason to live,
She needs the love that you give

Always remember that is what she lives for
She hopes you love her...
Tell her you love her!
Tell her you love her
Today!
