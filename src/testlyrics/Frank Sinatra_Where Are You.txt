Where are you, where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me, where are you
Where's my heart, where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is that happy ending, where are you, where are you
