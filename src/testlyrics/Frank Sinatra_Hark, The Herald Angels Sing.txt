Hark! the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!
 Peace on earth, and mercy mild
 God and sinners reconciled"
 Joyful, all ye nations, rise
 Join the triumph of the skies
 With th' angelic host proclaim
 "Christ is born in Bethlehem"
 Hark! the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!
 Christ, by highest heav'n adored
 Christ, the everlasting Lord
 Late in time behold him come
 Offspring of the favored one
 Veil'd in flesh, the Godhead see
 Hail, th'incarnate Deity
 Pleased, as man, with men to dwell
 Jesus, our Emmanuel!
 Hark! the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!
 Hail! the heav'n-born Prince of peace!
 Hail! the Son of Righteousness!
 Light and life to all he brings
 Risen with healing in his wings
 Mild he lays his glory by
 Born that man no more may die
 Born to raise the sone of earth
 Born to give them second birth
 Hark! the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!
