I'll walk alone because to tell you the truth I'll be lonely,
I don't mind being lonely when my hear tells me you are lonely too.
I'll walk alone, they'll ask me why and Ill tell them I'd rather.
There are dreams I must gather, dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight.

I'll always be near you wherever you are each night in every prayer.
If you call, I'll hear you, no matter how far.
Just close your eyes and I'll be there.
Please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me
Till you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone.
