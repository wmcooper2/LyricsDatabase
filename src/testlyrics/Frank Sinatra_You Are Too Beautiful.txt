You are too beautiful
My dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling
That because I had found you
I could have bound you to me.

You are too beautiful
For one man alone
One lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own
To see with.

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs?

If on the other hand
I'm faithful to you
It's not from a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool
For beauty.
