I would gather stars out of the blue, for you, for you.
I would make a string of pearls out of the dew, for you, for you.
Over the highway and over the street,
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet.

There's nothing in this world I would not do for you, just for you.
Over the highway and over the street,
Carpets of clover I'm gonna lay at your feet.
There is nothing in this world I would not do, baby, for you, just for you.
